Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 6 months ago (8/19/2020),Report,"I got the Mirena in Feb 2020. The insertion wasn't pleasant by any means. It was like instant contractions and my hands were gripping the table. I was pretty uncomfortable for the rest of that evening and the next day but I was able to manage any discomfort with ibuprofen. For the next couple of months I just went about my life...my job changed, covid hit so I thought I was feeling out of control because of those things. Until I really started paying attention.....I noticed my emotions were all over the map. I couldn't keep myself under control, I was crying all of the time. Some days my boyfriend was looking at me like....what is wrong????? Then I noticed the severe change in my appetite, I was hungry ALL OF THE TIME. All I wanted was salt and sugar ALL DAY LONG. My skin was a mess, broken out all of the time on my face, chest and back. I was having no period, just like they said I would. BUT I was having PMS everyday. 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with no period to show for it. Which I think messed me up mentally. Its like my body wanted to have a period so bad but it just couldn't. The weight gain happened slowly, at first it was 2lb, then 5lb.....which I was able to deal with.",

Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 6 months ago (8/19/2020),Report,"The biggest joke known to mankind. Doctor gave me this big story about how great it is. Crap. It destroyed my life. I ended up suffering with mental illness, cutting my hair off, rashes on my skin, quit my job because I was exhausted. No sex drive, pain down my body, my neck, everything havent had a period in a year. Had to tell the doctor to get it out of me. Failed to do a STI check beforehand. Now i have to be checked for cervical cancer after it perforated me. Im not even 40, had a successful life and this junk destroyed my fmeininity.",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 6 months ago (8/14/2020),Report,"I’ve had mirena for exactly one month now and it has been a complete nightmare. My doctor talked this up like it was the greatest thing on earth and the perfect solution for my horrible periods. The insertion was extremely painful, like I couldn’t button my pants, looked 6 months pregnant while I sat in my car outside the doctors office for 2 hours trying not to pass out type painful. I have been so bloated and gained 10 pounds in one month. I seriously look so swollen and bloated all the time that I look pregnant. My period lasted 2 1/2 weeks as well. The worst part is that my sex drive has completely vanished. I can’t even put it into words. It is completely taking a toll on my relationship. I keep thinking it’ll get better and people tell me to wait it out but I just can’t. My doctor is on vacation for the next week so I have to wait a week and a half to get it out and I want to scream.",
Rated  for Endometriosis Report,Posted 7 months ago (8/6/2020),Report,"I have a history of gushing, painful periods which included vomiting and literally scheduling my plans around my cycle. My gyne recommended Mirena. The insertion was EXCRUTIATING...so painful I almost passed out and couldn't go to work. I had shooting pain in my back for several months, as well as terrible cramps and bloating. Called the doc and was told that everything should settle down after a year. I'm 15 months in and will be making an appointment to get it removed.",
Rated  for Endometriosis Report,Posted 7 months ago (8/4/2020),Report,"I had the mirena inserted on the 12th of December 2019. The gynae recommended this to help with the intermittent bleeding I was experiencing & bleeding after painful sex. This has been by far the worst contraception I have been on. I bled every single day from the day it was inserted for 8 solid months. I have had terrible pelvic pain, bloating, a tender uterus & stomach, loss of libido, vaginal dryness, moodiness & a very foggy memory. The doctor said it can take up to 6 months to settle down but I persevered for 8 months & my bleeding was worst than before I had it put in. I finally took it out yesterday & I instantly felt better, it was so strange. I would never recommend this. The pain having it inserted & extracted was unbelievable too. I’ve had two cesarians & this felt worse.",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 7 months ago (7/31/2020),Report,"This birth control device ruined my life for a total of 9 months. The pros of mirena: easy and effective birth control that requires no upkeep after getting it inserted, I also experienced lighter periods. Cons of Mirena: I was in total and utter despair. I constantly had a buildup of tears behind my eyes, ready to burst out at the smallest of things. My head felt like a thunderstorm was brewing inside my brain. Life lost all of its color, I woke up every day dreading what was in store for me. I found no happiness in anything, I was a miserable wreck and I couldn’t understand why. Along with the extreme emotional and psychological effects I had such bad cramping I would just want to lie in bed for days on end. I got my mirena out a few days ago and everything is better. I feel no pain in my uterus, I feel excited for this life I get to live, I feel much more loving and happy with my boyfriend, I can have a bad experience without bursting into a hysterical fit of tears. My life is back now that I have gotten that horrible device removed from inside of me.",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 7 months ago (7/31/2020),Report,"I had the mirena for 8 months and could not stand it anymore. Constant cramping, random sharp pain which would make me fall to my knees, spotting to no period (still experience pms symptoms) Horrible mood swings, depression, decreased sex drive, uncomfortable or sometimes painful during or right after sex. Bloating, weight gain (and for the life of me of dieting and exercising, made no difference). Such a relief when I got it removed 2 weeks ago, felt instantly lighter, better mentally, bloating gone, libido is back and instantly started dropping weight. Only thing now, the bleeding is extreme, and has started to take a toll on me, but I know it will take time before my periods are under control again and get my energy back up. Getting the iud inserted, was the worst pain I felt in my life. The doctor that was assigned to me didn't have much experience, after 20 minutes of her poking around in my insides, she had to get another doctor to insert it, which went relatively quick after. Removal was quick and easy, thankfully.",

Rated  for Endometriosis Report,Posted 7 months ago (7/29/2020),Report,"My GP recommended Mirena to ease endometriosis pain and bleeding. Insertion was very painful, had cramping for about 2 days, my periods bleeding and pain started reducing after 2 months, and was gone in 4 months! Have had occational spotting about 3 times.

Rated  for Contraception Report,Posted 8 months ago (7/1/2020),Report,"I have very mixed feelings about Mirena. I took it for over a year and a half and there is so much to say about the range of effects it had on me. To begin, the insertion itself wasn’t at all as bad as some reviews. It was some pressure, but not at all painful. Until the next day— and let me tell you, the pain was so intense and horrible, I don’t even know how to describe it. That same pain/cramping would randomly occur for a few days each month pretty much for the entire time I had it. After 6months, I quickly noticed that my libido was nearly nonexistent and Mirena also made sex really unenjoyable because of how dry it made me, even with added lubricant. Finally, I decided to get it removed when one day, I couldn’t even move from my bed because the cramps were so unbearable. And I also think it’s relevant to mention that I have a pretty high pain tolerance and this was the worst ovarian pain I’ve ever, ever experienced. Long story short- after getting the IUD removed, I noticed massive mood shifts where I felt so much happier and less erratic, which I hadn’t even noticed had happened when I had the IUD. I only after getting it removed, that Mirena had made me super aggressive and",
Rated  for Endometriosis Report,Posted 8 months ago (6/29/2020),Report,"I've had endometriosis for over 20 years and had a tubaligation 11 years ago. My gyno, when I requested a hysterectomy for the endometriosis due to pain and bleeding issues, suggested the mirena. I allowed it. Although it did stop any excessive bleeding, I spotted constantly for 4 months and the cramping pain was even worse. I gained over 20 lbs in those 4 months (not due to diet), my blood pressure went dangerously high, I experienced bloating & IBS, my feet/ankles would painfully swell every day, I began to have migraines daily and nauseating dizziness. I had it removed 2 days ago. The cramping and migraines went away immediately, the dizziness is slowly subsiding, but, so far, the swelling has not gone away. It's been a terrible experience.",

Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 8 months ago (6/23/2020),Report,"Absolutely hate it. Have a meeting with my doctor to get it removed this week. Have tried for 2years to see if my body would adjust. I used to get bad cramps, but now my cramping is worse 10/10 and have frequent cramps throughout the month. Always bloated. I have gained weight and no matter what I do cannot get it off. I’ve never had acne in my life and now have it on my back and down my neck. Not worth its effectiveness for contraception.",
Rated  for Endometriosis Report,Posted 8 months ago (6/22/2020),Report,"Have had mirena for about 3 months. In terms of pain from the endometriosis, it’s been amazing. No massive pain like before that had me in tears for months , just on & off little periods like very very mild pain. Very happy with it. But recently been have been feeling a little overwhelming feeling in my head. Don’t think it’s depression but definitely a little empty feeling. Going to visit my GP on Wednesday to see if it’s related to hormones & mirena. I also feel little brain zaps like feeling at times on my brain. But in terms of pain, omg, it’s been heaven sent.",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 8 months ago (6/21/2020),Report,"I got this after trying about 7 other types of birth control for heavy, constant periods and finding out I couldn't have combined birth control due to unbearable side effects. It really was a last shot. The insertion was painful but nowhere near as bad as I thought and it was over quickly. I had cramps for about 3 weeks after but not worse than a regular period. My constant bleeding carried on for a while and then.. Just stopped. I have now had the coil for about 8 months and haven't bled for 6. I'm so happy because prior to this I had litrtally bled for 2 years straight and it was awful. Ocassionally I get a bit moody and PMS-y but this is a small price to pay for a birth control that has given me my life back. Plus you can just forget about it!",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 8 months ago (6/21/2020),Report,"I had the Mirena coil fitted after having my 3rd child when I was 35 year of age. It was horrible as I had a tilted cervix so it took almost an hour to put it in the correct place and boy it was painful. I bled for 10 weeks solid afterwards but then my periods slowed down then stopped altogether. I am now 51 and still have the original Mirena that was fitted 16 years ago! I saw my GP last year about going through the menopause and she insisted that before they can give me any menopause treatment, she wanted the coil removed, I refused as now I can imagine it would have become attached to my cervix and as it was so painful going in, I can imagine it will be painful being pulled out. I have high blood pressure, migraines, bloated ness, cramps, mood swings and can not seem to lose weight. I have never thought that any of these symptoms were due to the coil but when I look back, the coil was fitted before any of these started to happen. The problem now is that I still can not go and have the coil removed as it gives me anxiety just thinking about the pain and if it doesn’t come out easily, I don’t want to go through that pain again.",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 8 months ago (6/19/2020),Report,I have had the mirena for 2 years. Decided to try it after having my baby and the pills made me constantly bleed. This experience hasn't been much better the first year I bleed non stop. After the first year got a little better now for the last wish months I move the wrong way I start bleeding. They prescribed me bc pills to go along with it... still bleeding. Masturbation no penetration I bleed. Sneeze I bleed. It's getting taken out asap. I do not recomend this at all,
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 8 months ago (6/17/2020),Report,"Ok, I am on my second one. The first was in for a couple years and I thought it was great. No periods was amazing. I did progressively gain a little weight but I hadn't really tried to get rid of it. I had a baby and then got another one right away and my five years is up next month and I'm trying to decide if I get another one or not. I don't even remember what it's like to have a monthly period, which is still amazing, but over time I've gained a fair amount of weight and it just won't go away, no matter how hard I push myself. I do have yeast infections pretty often now that I never had previously in my life but I never thought it could have been because of my mirena until reading reviews on here today. I did also get migraines, which I attributed to something else too until reading things today. It seems like a few things seemed to slowly creep in and I didn't realize that it could be related to my IUD. I'm thinking I'll get it taken out and see how things roll for a while and then make the decision to get it again or possibly try something new.",
Rated  for Contraception Report,Posted 8 months ago (6/15/2020),Report,"I had an awful experience with Mirena. Was told by GP and doctor who fitted it that there were no bad side effects at all. I had it in for about a year and actually felt suicidal. It gave me chronic fatigue, terrible ovulation pain, vertigo, insomnia, bloating, breast tenderness and depression. Within a few days and weeks of removal I was feeling so much better. The GPs are either not telling the truth about how this can effect you, or don't want to know.",

Rated  for Endometriosis Report,Posted 9 months ago (6/6/2020),Report,"I had the Mirena placed March 5, 2020. I had spotting each month for about 15 days. So much better than my gushing heavy 10 day cycles wherein I could not leave the house even wearing a super duper tampon and a diaper pad. I’m 51. I did have bad acne the first month but by this month it settled down so it wasn’t a major symptom. However, I have been on blood pressure medication for one year. 3 weeks ago my hands, feet and legs started swelling and my blood pressure was consistently averaging 150/100 even on my medication and in a resting state. Both my gyno and doctor said it could not be the Mirena however my gyno said we should error on the side of caution and remove it to see if I improved. I had it removed two days ago (after 3 months almost exactly) and 3 weeks since my symptoms started. The swelling in my hands feet and legs is gone already and my blood pressure started to drop and day two after removal is Now averaging a 130/85. There definitely was a correlation between the Mirena and my blood pressure.",

Constantly bloating.. weight gain 20lbs.. and most recently a skin rash in random spots. Not to mention my uterus is enlarged 3x the size. I was completely fine before mirena. Gettin this bitch out asap. Doing more harm than good. Only great thing about it is no periods. I would rather bleed heavily than destroy my insides completely because of mirena. Never again.,
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 9 months ago (5/15/2020),Report,After having a baby I was freaked out by all the stories of getting pregnant right away again so o decided to buckle down . The insertion was uncomfortable to say the least .. after about having it in for a week I’ve started noticing that I am back gaining my weight thag I lost after having my baby .. so I decided to hit it hard and work out .. when I tell you NOTHING OR NO AMOINT OF EXCERCISE has made my weight go down .. I constantly feel Bloated .. I have cramps and I’m just moody .. I have decided to take it out after having it in for three months . This is horrible for ladies that are body conscious .. I will never ever put it back in after it is out . Also weird spotting on it as well,
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 9 months ago (5/14/2020),Report,"I started on Mirena in September of 2017. Insertion was uncomfortable but I knew that going in to it and it didnt last long, Nurse held my hand and helped in the best way possible. Fast forward to the end of 2019 and I started to notice mood swings. Not just any mood swings but TERRIBLE mood swings (lashing out, crying for no reason, feelings of depression). It was terrible because I thought I was a bad person and something was wrong with me. I then started noticing my mood swings were worse while on my period. I still got periods every month but they were light but sometimes lasted up to 10 days. After I realized the Mirena was causing all of this discomfort, I finally had it removed TODAY (May 2020). It may be in my head, but I immediately could tell a difference in my mental health. Every woman is different but for me, hormonal birth control is not worth my mental health.",

Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 9 months ago (5/12/2020),Report,"Hello, I just got my 4th Mirena this morning. I have to say that I really love my experience with the Mirena. I havent had any side-effects. During the insert, you do feel pressure and (1) small cramp, (1) BIG cramp and (1) small cramp... Normally in that exact order. My very 1st Mirena was somewhat painful due to not having any children but the other ones have been a breeze.. I would recommend the Mirena to anyone... I normally start the night before taking Motrin, up until its time for my new Mirena. I do cramp afterwards but the cramps normally ease off about 2-3 hrs later.... I hope this is helpful.",

Rated  for Endometriosis Report,Posted 10 months ago (4/11/2020),Report,"I had my mirena put in during surgery for removal of some endometriosis. I was told that it would help with my endometriosis and adenomyosis. I persevered with the more a for 16 months, believing that surely it would be any time now that my body would ""adjust"" to it and things would get better. They never did. I bled or spotted the entire time I had it. I was lucky to have a few hours per day where there was no spotting. Couldn't have sex due to this anyway, but even when I did it would cause me to bleed. It also took away my libido almost completely and exacerbated my depression. The pain whilst I had this in was also like nothing I have ever experienced, even with my existing health issues. It was often and intense. I have had it out for 4 weeks now and have had no pain and much less bleeding even in that short time. I believe that my body was trying to expel the mirena and that it and that it didn't agree with it at all. I know some people swear by the mirena but for me it made everything worse.",
Rated  for Endometriosis Report,Posted 10 months ago (4/9/2020),Report,I got the Mirena 2/21/20 Not for birth control (hubby has vasectomy) but to help with my heavy periods that make me extra tired (I also have cancer and am on chemo which was making my periods worse). It didn’t hurt much going in (I have 2 children) felt fine except for spotting. But I bled every single day fairly heavy. I used so many tampons and pads it was crazy. I ruined almost every pair of underwear. I was already anemic and I’m sure I’m even more now. I tried giving it 2 full months but finally got is taken out 4/8/20 giving it 7 weeks. I was non stop bleeding. Which made it hard to have sex and I was getting even more tired then before. I’m going to try an ablation as soon as this covid 19 passes. I personally do not recommend the Mirena. If my doctor told me I would bleed non stop I wouldn’t have gotten it. They made it seem like small spotting might occur here and there. Not non stop bleeding every single day! No thank you!,
Rated  for Contraception Report,Posted 10 months ago (4/9/2020),Report,"I had the Mirena inserted in Dec 2019 after almost 10 years on the pill (no children). The insertion experience was relatively uncomfortable but no real pain and only took a few minutes. I had to sit in the Drs Office for 10 minutes or so afterwards as I felt dizzy (drop in blood pressure is apparently a common and natural reaction to this procedure) but that was the worst part. I had mild cramping that day but just took it easy with a hot waterbottle at hand. The first month I had pretty heavy and ongoing bleeding, second month less so but still sporadic spotting. Third month this had mostly cleared up with spotting only during sex, but now the first three months have passed I just a very light bleed ever 3-6 weeks. I would really recommend the Mirena coil if you are looking for a long term contraception that you don't need to think about. If you can make it through the uncomfortable insertion and some ongoing bleeding to begin with it's be worth it for the 5 years of peace of mind.",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 11 months ago (3/31/2020),Report,"For those that have opted to use Mirena to treat their heavy bleeding and are considering to take it out for X,Y,Z reasons... please pump the brakes. I have a real life experience with abnormal uterine bleeding from November 2019 until March 2020. I was wasting my life away tolerating my heavy bleeding. I would bleed from 10 to 23 days straight at times and treated with Provera to stop my bleeding and would consequently have withdrawal bleeding. It was a never ending vicious cycle. It robbed me of having a normal life and let alone my intimacy. I would bleed profusely and with heavy clots. Two weeks ago, this heavy bleeding damn nearly killed me. I needed a blood transfusion. I was given two bags. I was given the Mirena as an outpatient visit after my hospital discharge. I am grateful that I see absolutely no spotting. Spotting alone gave me anxiety as it was a reminder I was going to resume bleeding again. As long as this bleeding is kept a bay and never comes back I will stick with the Mirena. I am traumatized with vaginal bleeding. I never want to see a period again. So far since my insertion 2 weeks ago no bleeding and I'm still taking Provera to prevent bleeding at all costs",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 11 months ago (3/28/2020),Report,"For me, insertion was totally painless both times I've had it. I only had light cramping afterward. It was fast and easy. Adjusting to it the first time was a bit frustrating as I spotted for probably a full 3 months before it finally stopped, but after that I've never had a problem and it's been awesome not having full blown periods (although my breasts still swell and I'll get occasional cramps and spotting still) Even the removal of the first one was painless. I'm really glad I got it! In my opinion, its definitely one of the best birth control options out there.",
Rated  for Contraception Report,Posted 11 months ago (3/28/2020),Report,"I had the Mirena coil fitted 5 days ago. I already have 4 children, I’m very forgetful with taking the pill so this seemed like the perfect option for me . The nurses were fab, she made sure I was relaxed and comfortable throughout and explained what was happening in each stage . The only uncomfortable bit for me was when she wound open the speculum to open the vaginal wall . I didn’t feel anything else but then I have had 4 children . straight away I had spotting (normal) and still spotting 5 days later . The nurse just said this will go and settle down it’s just from insertion. I had had some cramping but mild now and then . I am hoping to keep this in for the full 5years and hoping my periods will stop . ???? This works for me","I hate this thing and can't wait to get it removed (once Doctor's offices are re-opened after Coronavirus lockdown). I had it inserted 2 months ago (Feb 2020) and have not stopped bleeding/ spotting every since. I got it for birth control purposes but now that is a moot point as with all of this gross dark brown spotting sex is undesirable for both me and my partner anyways. Plus, my libido went way down almost immediately anyways. One one attempted try for intimacy it was more uncomfortable than usual. I am so disappointed and feel disgusting and can't wait to get it removed. What a waste of $2500!!!!"

Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 11 months ago (3/25/2020),Report,"Everyone is different. Personally I found the Mirena to be a very effective form of birth control and after the 1st year it completely got rid of my periods. The insertion was done and the Dr was kind enough to numb my cervix before hand. Normal progesterone and estrogen birth control makes me extremely depressed. The biggest down side is the insertion, then the removal as they are both invasive and the insertion is painful. The next few days were cramping and mild bleeding.

The doctor talked it up lots and said it was the perfect option for me. Firstly, the insert was the most painful thing I've ever experienced. I later found out it's common practise to do it under anaesthesia because it's THAT painful.. to be fair, it has stopped my periods so it's done it's job there. But my sex drive is GONE. Ontop of this, mood swings, depression and anxiety are now a common theme in my life. And the weight gain... 4kgs in just a couple of months that I still can't lose! I am tired, bloated and pudgy constantly. I'm getting it taken out in a few days to see if it makes any difference because I'm at my wits end. I would rather deal with heavy periods than what I'm dealing with now.",

The first year I had really bad cramping and spotting which kinda eased off. I AM CURRENTLY IN HOSPITAL as I fell pregnant with the coil still perfectly in place. Unfortunatly turned out to be an ectopic pregnancy (which is what usually happens when you get pregnant with the coil), meaning is not a viable pregnancy and there's serious risk for my life. I strongly recommend not having the mirena coil as this situation is been extremely traumatising and potencially life threatening.",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 12 months ago (3/6/2020),Report,"I’ve had the Mirena for almost 2 years and I’m so glad I got it taken out. I won’t say that I had the worst experience ever, cause it did do it’s job. I never experienced weight gain (but I’m also active duty military so we have to be in shape), I never experienced nausea, and I rarely ever had a period. However, I did experience severe depression and anxiety. Through out the entire 2 years. My moods were really unstable in the beginning but ofc it takes time for your body to get use the the bc. But after getting it removed, I haven’t been depressed or anxious like that since. Also it was causing my hair to thin/excessive shedding! My doctor said it wasnt the iud and to use rogain..... ever since I’ve had the iud out, my hair sheds about 1/4 the amount it did! Crazy how that works..... anywho and also sex could be very uncomfortable for me sometimes. There were some positions I couldn’t do cause it was just too tender or sensitive that day. Also I was always worried about the iud shifting and me not knowing it. So I’d recommend doing what you think is best for YOU... not your doctor. Also, dont ignore any signs and see if the side effects r worth it. Cause no bc is perfect.",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 12 months ago (2/25/2020),Report,"I started Mirena after giving birth to my second child because the pill was ineffective with my medication. I didn’t have any issues with Paraguard and my doctor recommended Mirena. After the initial use I had light bleeding, until there was just none. I had no periods at all. For about four and a half years I was fine. So in October I had it removed to have another baby. So I remember what I went through when I had the paraguard. I think I only was on that was two years. I went off of it to have my second child and had to wait two period cycles for the clots to come out. Not too much of a problem. Now with the Mirena I've had that in for almost 4 and a half years and after five period cycles I am just now expelling the big clots. Currently in fifth cycle since the removal and the biggest clots are JUST now coming out. I think that if I wanna have a baby next month I won't have any more issues. I’m really crossing my fingers. I didn’t read anything about fertility issues, so I think I’ll be fine.",

Had it put in July 20219 just had it removed February 2020. Insertion was uncomfortable but bearable. That first evening I was in the worst pain felt like my insides were bring ripped out this went on for the first five days. After that I had cramping even when not on period or ovulating. I knew to expect an adjustment period but my body never adjusted. It started out as bad cramps during my periods for which it was supposed to help minimise cramping and bleeding. This did the complete opposite. My periods were heavy and lasted 3 weeks each month and the cramps were terrible. A few months in I started getting terrible hormonal acne and mood swings. I developed depression and my anxiety became worse. I really wanted to see if my body would adjust to it but I think I have it as long as I could my mind and soul was just not in it in the end.,

Rated  for Endometriosis Report,Posted 12 months ago (2/9/2020),Report,"I had the mirena inserted to try stop heavy painful periods. I had previously tried oral contraceptives but encountered side effects that impacted my mental health significantly. I was told by several doctors and a gynaecologost that the mirena coil would be different as the hormone is emitted 'locally' in the womb and shouldn't affect my mental health. They couldn't have been more wrong! After a week of having it in, once again the anxiety and insomnia started with no external trigger whatsoever. Luckily this time round I was able to realise these symptoms were related to the mirena. When this happened me before I blamed it on myself not the synthetic hormones. As a result I suffered with poor mental health for 3 years. Word of advice - if your mental health changes on synthetic hormones and you're not yourself trust your gut and stop the hormones. I appreciate plenty of women get on just fine with this drug but I assume I am particularly sensitive to synthetic hormones.",

After that, it was smooth sailing with no periods, very few period symptoms at all, and very reliable birth control. The second and third insertion did not result in any bleeding. I did not have other side effects, such as acne or weight gain. The Mirena changed my life in very positive ways and I highly recommend the experience.

I still had back issues. about 5 years later I had to get my copper one replaced and chose the Kyleena because they said it had less hormones and fewer side effects. I did not have any anxiety but I did experience major back pains and soreness. I went online again to see if IUD's had any correlation with back pain and back related problems. I read that the hormones in the Kyleena and Mirena weaken your pelvic muscles and joints... So i went back to the doctor and had my Kyleena removed. I decided it was a good time to have a tubal ligation. I have not had any back problems since I had the IUD taken out. I had back issues for 13 years!

Insertion was very painful for several seconds like an intense period cramp and I must say that I did have severe cramping for quite a few weeks until my body got used to it. 5 months after insertion no periods - yay! 5 years later I've just had my second one fitted which was more stressful as the threads had disappeared and I had to have a scan and then removal at the hysteroscopy clinic but if you can cope with what is like a v uncomfortable smear (probably better if you've had kids) and deal with cramps for up to around a month (some people only get them for a few days) you will probably think it's the best thing ever!,

I got this as I just had our second child and we are about 60% sure we don’t want more kids so we wanted something to last a couple years but that wasn’t permanent (if we wanted permanent he is going to get the snip snip) I’ve had some spotting but my first period was legit amazing compared to before (no cramping, barely any clotting, and a light to regular flow) I’ve had a couple of headaches but they aren’t too bad and rarely require any pain relief. I’m pretty happy so far with the Mirena but like every other birth control you should read the insert, ask questions and also check reviews before inserting.

The procedure was horrendous and I’ve not felt any pain like it, must be akin to childbirth. I cried and begged the gynaecologist to stop. Since insertion I’ve had spotting through to heavy bleeding daily and terrible cramps. I was also starting to lose my hair which is thin anyway. Today I had it removed and the pain had subsided straight away. I will never have it fitted again. Following my experience I’ve read up on it and don’t think it’s suitable for young child less women.",

Rated  for Contraception Report,Posted 20 months ago (6/16/2019),Report,I got my first Mirena at age 50 to help with heavy bleeding and pre-menopause symptoms. I have now had it for 2 years. I would have likely chosen this form of birth control many years before but previous ob/gyns did not want to insert one because I had never had children. I do think the insertion experience depends a lot on the expertise of the physician. I will admit it was rather uncomfortable having it put in but it is a quick process. I experienced mild cramping and slight spotting that first day or two then nothing thereafter. I was back to marathon training within a matter of days. If I could go back in time I would opt for the Mirena over the pill. I have not had a period or any spotting for 2 years. That has been wonderful!,

I also had some horrendous heavy bleeding from a fibroid recently (3 units of blood lost in a week - definitely wouldn’t survive losing blood at that rate!) I hate taking pills because my mood is too unstable on them & the depo injection made me gain a lot of weight. My Mirena was inserted by an obstetrician after a hysteroscopy so the insertion was nothing compared to what i’d already had done. Have had slight spotting on and off & maybe lost a bit more hair than usual but who cares. Thoroughly recommend.,

My dr wants me to take pill for 3 months to see if that'll regulate the spotting but considering I'm 1/2 through the 3 months with no change.

A week after my insertion I started spotting and this continued for a whole month so I was very frustrated at that point. After that month-long period everything settled and I’m very happy. I get light spotting and cramping for 2 days every 35 days and that’s it! I have noticed a little bit of weight gain and some acne but that might be attributable to eating lots of chocolate.

The removal/insertion combo was a bit more painful with cramps lasting intermittently for 2-3 days that time, though it wasn’t intolerable and the worst of it was over after a few hours. PERIODS: I had extremely heavy 7-10 day periods every month for most of my adult life, so in that regard Mirena has been a God-send to me. I had mild spotting for approx. 2 months after insertion of the first IUD and then absolutely nothing for ~12 yrs – hallelujah!! Well, that is until about 6 months ago. I started spotting again and it’s gotten a little worse each month, though still nothing like a normal period.

While I had Mirena I experienced severe, chronic suicidal ideation that peaked before my period. Although I have mental health problems I had never felt suicidal until Mirena. It took me years to connect the dots and finally decide to get it out (since as birth control it is so very convenient and effective). I got my Mirena out one month ago and am happy to say that I am having a healthy period and normal pms free of suicidal thoughts. For some reason this side effect is information my doctor left out pre-insertion, despite knowing my history. I'm not recommending against this product, but I do wish there were greater awareness around this very intense and troubling side effect. If you get Mirena, stay in check with yourself if you think you are at all vulnerable to an experience like mine.",

I had it removed a couple months later only because my husband would complain about being able to feel the strings. Other than his complaints about the strings, I personally had no side effects or issues with the mirena. Just be prepared after having it place to take it easy, take some tylenol or advil, a warm bath, and a heating pad!

After more research I realized my acne problems and hair loss was because of the Mirena. I had them remove and the doctor tried to convince to [put another one in, but I refused. It's now been been almost 5 months and I feel so much more mentally and emotionally healthier. I didn't even correlate my mental health with the Mirena. I had to go on anxiety medication and antidepressant last year. I felt like I was losing my mind. I enjoyed nothing, was sad, very anxious all the time. I did not enjoy sex. My medication made my symptoms worse, so I stopped after a couple of months. It wasn't until I had the IUD removed and it was a couple months later when I felt SO MUCH BETTER!! Never again will I use an IUD again or anything hormonal. And for anyone reading this and thinking they will use the Copper IUD since it doesn't have hormones. Look into copper in your body, it is bad for you too.",

The sex hormones used in the mirena - estrogen and progesterone - impact emotional and cognitive processing (which then impacts your ability to regulate your mood). I haven’t been able to control my emotions!!! It’s like im in a constant state of pregnant woman hysteria.

The past four months I have had non-stop bleeding/spotting and heavy mucus. I went and got an ultrasound to check the placement and nothing was wrong, so I decided to ride it out and see if it gets any better.

My mother had two Mirena IUDs placed before and they have worked wonderfully for her, so she thought that I should receive one as well to treat my periods and for birth control! The day of the placement was a bit painful. I had bad cramps, to begin with, the IUD placement was like a really bad cramp. I had psyched myself up to that point and thought I was going to die -- my anxiety put me in more pain than was necessary. Take a breath! It barely took THREE MINUTES for my doctor to measure and place my IUD. She was noticeably experienced. After I got it placed I bled very heavily, like a usual period. I continued to bleed for approximately five months. Sometimes it was heavy, sometimes it was light. I have had the IUD coming up on two years and all my bleeding has virtually stopped. I sometimes experience light bleeding, NOTHING compared to before. I totally recommend Mirena for peace of mind, relief for pain, and for easy convenience.

When I first got it inserted and had cramps and was very uncomfortable I ended up turning white as a ghost and had to lay down while my legs were still open lol and having nurses bring me water and crackers and laying there for 30 minutes was not the best experience. After about a few months I started gaining weight and so far I've gained 15 pounds it's crazy! Now im having Headaches, breasts hurt grumpy back and front cramping all of a sudden spotting never had that in the last 11 months I've had it. I've decided to get Mirena removed and get a tubal ligation as I don't want anymore children. Great for not wanting to get pregnant and great if you don't want a period.",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 26 months ago (12/27/2018),Report,"I'm really unsure about the Mirena at the moment. I'm 39 , 2 kids and had it inserted for contraception and primarily to stop heavy periods. I've had it for 6 months. So the insertion wasn't particularly pleasant but was absolutely nothing compared to giving birth - just like a weird smear test. The first 3 months I bled constantly which kind of defeated the object of getting it for me. I also experienced very sore breasts and acne (my skin previously was clear) Now for 2 months and I admit I have no idea whether this is related to the Mirena I have developed piles and anal fissure and also have pain the my right buttock, hip and upper thigh. This is only on one side. I have had a normal cycle for 1 month with an extremely light period- maybe 2 light tampons worth- this is brilliant compared to the flooding and clots. My libido has increased- I think this might be because my anemia is improving. So a mixed bag. I'm seeing an osteo for hip pain etc. If it has been caused by hormones I hope it abates when the dose decreases? I'm not sure what I will do- whether to get it removed. I was so tired with the heavy periods.",

So my doctor convinced me to get Mirena for heaving bleeding, so I did. In 2012, I had emergency surgery for ovary torsion (life threatening) and the Mirena wasn't removed.

The Hubby was previously fixed so while the Mirena does work for contraception it's not my focus. As Mirena doesnt contain estrogen, it does cut down on the regular hormonal migraine i would get each month when I would have my period. I have been working with doctors to also take some profolactic medications for migraines. For my PCOS I also saw a dermatologist who prescribed better creams for my cystic acne than you can get at the drug store. I had the acne before the Mirena. I'm in my later 30's. After trying to insert in office without success, I had my Mirena inserted under general anesthesia as recommended by my doctor as I have not had a child and have a heart shaped uterus. There was some pain and cramping. The first year of spotty and inconsistent periods was annoying, but once you get through that it is pretty nice to be period free.

Both times felt like a really intense period cramp that lasted maybe 10 seconds. After that it felt just like regular cramps that stopped and started every couple minutes. I sat around in the exam room for a little bit and left the office after about 15 minutes. My husband drove me home which was an extremely good choice because I almost passed out on the way home!

However, I did spot off and on for the first 3 months and experienced some crapping, but nothing unbearable. I have not experienced a cycle since then and no side effects (that I know of). For me, the Mirena was easier than trying to take a birth control pill at the same time everyday. I have no regrets, nor complaints. I am satisfied with my decision to get the Mirena.",
Rated  for Contraception Report,Posted 28 months ago (11/3/2018),Report,I had mirena inserted in 2008 after 9 yrs had it removed to try to conceive (the same one) After a year of trying can’t seem to get pregnant. I advise anyone who still want kids later in life to take into concideration how long they leave the mirena in place and their age when planning on having it removed. I am in my late 30 so that can be playing a role in my fertility .My period did return 2 weeks after removal and has been normal every since. I was on the depo and got pregnant 4 months after coming off of it. I always had acne so I can’t say for sure if mirena made it worst. Since i had it removed my face has cleared up . I don’t know if thats do to the mirena removal or my new acne medication.,

Insertion wasn’t bad, but I had horrible cramping and bleeding for the next few days. I would have periods that would last for 2 weeks and the blood was a dark brown color. I had extremely painful cramps during my period and during and after sex. Sex was extremely uncomfortable and hurt. It also hurt my husband every time because the string would poke him. After expressing these concerns to my doctor, she recommended that I keep waiting because it would get better. It only ever got worse. After a year and a half of painful cramps, painful sex, very long periods and bleeding after sex, I finally couldn’t take it any longer and had it taken out. I went back on birth control pills and everything changed immediately. I would never recommend mirena iud to anyone.",

No periods for 8 years has been the best side effect. Just got it removed and a second one in today. It was definitely more painful being inserted, but not unbearable. I forgot to take ibuprofen before this time, so that is probably why. Got up right after, drove home and took ibuprofen and felt completely fine. I did notice a very small weight gain after getting my first mirena, but for me it is worth it to not have to think about birth control or periods.",

I had previously tried all types of birth control but nothing worked. Then I asked my OB about the Mirena. I had seen the commercials and it seemed effective and painless. She explained that my body would need 6 months before it got used to it but I should be fine. Let me tell u the 6 months are NO JOKE. I was at my breaking point. Pushed to the limit 3 months in I ended up in the ER because the pain had become so severe I physically couldn't walk. There they suggested I weight it out another 3 months,and I did. After the 6 months passed I could finally get some rest. Now I barely have cramps at all and have almost lost my period completely. I suffered for half a year but not everyone can which is why I don't want to reccomend it. Trust me if you can't really tolerate pain then dont do it.",

I did read all the bad reviews about the pain. Not as bad as they stated. Im sure because I relaxed myself, my mind, my body, specially my hips, and pelvic area as much as possible. Relaxing is key!! I took advil 15 minutes before. Im about 7 weeks postpartum. Had 3 csections. My cervix dialated 2cm before I went in for my 3rd csection. I feel like this helped since I now have a high pain tolerance for the after pains of csections. Was a piece of cake. Only cramped later that night. Went to bed and pain disappeared completely. Only wearing a panty liner. Has watery discharge with a pinkish tint. I feel GREAT.",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 28 months ago (10/28/2018),Report,"I'm usually not one to write reviews but I want to protect anybody and everybody considering to get on the Mirena. The insertion process was BY FAR the MOST painful thing I have ever experienced. I got it in around 7am and was bedridden until 4pm and couldn't do any intense exercise until around 8pm. I bawled my eyes out from the ongoing pain that lasted from insertion to about 3-4 hours later. Don't believe people when they tell you the pain stops when the Mirena is placed-it continues with INTENSE cramping. And to make things worse, I have now been on my period for 3 straight months with a week break about 2 months in. So yeah the Mirena is effective-it's effective because it is impossible to have sex while you are on it! The worst part-it hurts my boyfriend to have sex with me. He feels the strings every time and they are supposedly very painful. It's causing issues in our relationship and this birth control was the WORST decision I have EVER made. On top of all of that, I can no longer feel ""horny"". It has messed with my hormones and I no longer desire sex. Scheduling to get it taken out ASAP. DO NOT GO ON THE MIRENA!",

The experience with removal and fitting was uncomfortable. It wasn't painful but internally uncomfortable but quick. I took x 2 cocodamol and 400mg of ibuprofen 45 minutes before and would definitely recommend to do this more that it helps with the cramps afterwards. Don't be put off by bad reviews though it is uncomfortable it's not awful and it is manageable and in my opinion worth it. If I had to have it done again tomorrow I would.

Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 28 months ago (10/20/2018),Report,"Okay- so I made the mistake of reading these reviews WHILE I sat at the docs office waiting for mine to come in and insert this. That was a bad idea on my part- I’m going to be honest, either most women are complete babies and very dramatic or perhaps their doctors rammed the IUD inside them with a crane. Either way, I was extremely apprehensive after I read these and nearly left. My doc came in and gave me a Motrin and explained everything. When she “measured” me, she said I’d feel a pretty big cramp. I felt nothing. Then she said I’d feel another one after she put the device in. I did feel that- a strong period cramp and it was over in seconds. It took her less than two minutes to do everything. Now- here’s my perspective: I think women who have had babies might have an easier time. I also think if you find Pap smears painful, you’ll find this painful. I think paps are a breeze. Since having it in I’ve had no issues (yet) other than some dizziness. In any event- don’t go by the reviews. Everyone is so different!!",

I went on mirena for birth control and was excited to try something new besides the pill. I did not get pregnant during this time so it did it’s job, however I experienced horrible side effects. My period was irregular and would just appear out of no where. One day I got my period at work and stained my clothes, I did not even see it coming, it was like a high school nightmare. I have also been dealing with acne on my back, butt and face since starting mirena. I went to see a dermatologist who put me on a pill... the whole reason I went on mirena was to stop taking pills..... all of this was not worth it and I decided life would be more enjoyable being back on the pill. Having the mirena inserted was EXTREMELY painful. Maybe it is because I have never had a child but I have never experienced cramping that badly in my entire life. I should have listened to my body then. I have a few other friends who have had the mirena as well and have taken it out for similar reasons. It works for some people and doesn’t for others, however I would never reccomend it to someone after my experience.",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 28 months ago (10/16/2018),Report,"I'm 21 and have never had kids. I had gotten the Mirena inserted in march of this year. It was uncomfortable, not so much as painful having it inserted, it was very quick and my doctor was great with it. The rest of the day however felt like I had gotten a heavy period all of a sudden, but the following days were fine. Following months my periods were gone which was great, I had an increase in my sex drive, and I didn't have to remember having to take anything. In July I started bleeding heavily constantly, and I couldn't have sex because it was causing my boyfriend pain. I had a check up in August, turns out it had been dislodged and had been crammed in my vagina where I couldn't feel it to test for strings. I had it removed and had Skyla inserted same day. And now I am experiencing same pain and bleeding again and I think I have the same problem with the skyla. So I do recommend for women to get it, it was great for me when it worked, but for my body, it just doesn't seem to be able to accept iuds. Just keep in mind all bodies are different.",

I had it in for a year and a half and participated in no other uses for safe sex. No pull out, no condoms, and I never got pregnant. However, the side effects for me were awful. Metabolism went way down. I had no energy. I gained about 50 pounds, but didn’t change the way I ate. I didn’t have a period which was pretty nice, but at the same time I kept having the urge to just want to bleed to get all of the hormones out. My sex drive went way up, but my confidence went way down which counteracts itself. I would want to have sex, but would be too self conscious to let my own fiancée see my body. This lasted the entire time I was on it. I got it taken out about 3 months ago and started a diet pill (most OB’s provide them) and I have been feeling phenomenal. So much energy all the time. I lost 25 pounds (may be from the diet pill) and I’m just so happy all the time. We do participate in safe sex (condoms, pulling out, ect.) and have been perfectly fine, pregnancy wise.

I have noticed signs of hair loss, dizzy, feeling of balance and sometimes sharp pain in the stomach and a lot more emotional now. I'm 27 and I will put up with side affects so I can have normal work life for Now. If I didnt have endometriosis I would 100% get it removed.",

Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 30 months ago (9/5/2018),Report,"I could not frown upon getting the mirena iud any more. I am a very healthy 17 year old and decided to get the mirena as a convenient form of birth control. Immediately after insertion (which was incredibly painful), the bleeding and cramping began. A 7 day period is already bad enough, but mine lasted for 30 days with cramping that would stop me in my tracks from pain. I had it taken out after a month and that same day went back onto my oral birth control. I thought this would stop the obnoxious symptoms of bleeding and cramping, but now 6 days after I am still bleeding spontaneously. I will wait another month for my body to regulate, but no device this small should change my mood, body, and quality of life this dramatically. Just take the pill each day, it's so much better than mirena.",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 30 months ago (9/1/2018),Report,"I had Mirena inserted May 4th of this year, the insertion itself wasn't bad but I had some horrible cramping for a few hours afterwards. Each period that I've had in the last four months has decreased in amount but not so much for duration which is about 2 weeks of pantyliners at this point. Prior to mirena I was using 6-8 overnight pads a day for 4 or 5 days with no spotting. 1st cycle after insertion was 3or4 pads for 4 days with 16 days of spotting. 2nd cycle 2 or 3 pads a day for 4 days with 14 daya of spotting. 3rd cycle was 1 pad a day for a day with 14 days of spotting. 4th cycle was 2 days of multiple pantyliners then 12 days of spotting. Currently on cycle 5 and it's a pantyliner. Im going to give this iud a full year but I'm really hoping atleast the duration will short to pre-iud length but no period would be great. If things go well I plan on keep using mirena till menopause and Im currently 35",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 30 months ago (9/1/2018),Report,"Absolute worst decision I ever made. I decided to try Mirena as a few of my friends use it and had no complaints but for me it has been a nightmare. It's been in for over 6 months and I literally bleed about 90% of the time. I went back to the Dr and she did an internal exam and sent me for an ultrasound to see if it was sitting in the right spot and everything checked out there. It's certainly an awesome form of birth control because if you're bleeding ALL the time you sure aren't having sex! This has taken not only a mental toll but a toll on my relationship as well. My Dr asked me to be patient and see if it levels out but it hasn't at all. I have an appointment in a week to have it removed and I can't wait, sorry I ever got it in the first place. May work for some women but obviously not all and in my case it's been a bloody(pun intended) nightmare.",
Rated  for Endometriosis Report,Posted 30 months ago (8/30/2018),Report,"At 39 with fibroids and heavy bleeding, it made total sense and it worked for many years. Now, 10 years and 3 mirenas later,it was doing more harm than good. Within a week of having it removed my sex drive and physiological responses to stimulation returned. Intercourse was no longer painful. The constant spotting stopped entirely. The bloating in my lower abdomen disappeared. It was a transformation that was obvious. While my gyno had been suggesting therapy, all I needed was to have the Mirena removed. Don't get me wrong, at the time it served its purpose but at some point, it became a negative and no medical professional thought to eliminate it. I'm happy to say after having the Mirena removed, I am off the list for a hysterectomy with normal periods. Fortunately I don't require it for birth control as my husband has had a vasectomy. I'm glad I decided to have the Mirena removed and had this trial period before my doc did an unnecessary hysterectomy.",

Rated  for Endometriosis Report,Posted 30 months ago (8/21/2018),Report,"So the real reason I had the mirena placement is because my periods were extremely heavy and causing me to be anemic. I was tired of changing my pads & super plus tampons on an hourly basis. Yes I had to use both at the same time because I was that heavy. I was desperate. My doctor suggested the Mirena. So I had it placed on my third day of my cycle. My second and third days are HORRIBLE. A complete nightmare. I was warned that it may cause heavier bleeding. I thought... how much worse could it be than the cycles I've grown accustomed this past year. So i was expecting the worse. Oh and behold, day #3 was delightful. Aside from a little cramping here and there because my uterus was adjusting, all was good. My periods were also lasting like 7-8 days. The doctor informed me that I may have spotting here and there. Come the 5th day of my cycle (2nd on mirena) all bleeding stopped. I had slight spotting on the 5th day of using Mirena, but it was one time for lke maybe 5 minutes. I know I haven't been on it nearly long enough to see if and/or how my body will adjust to but so far it's been WONDERFUL to me. I cannot complain at all.",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 30 months ago (8/21/2018),Report,My period were extremely irregular and the back cramps I got when on them were pretty bad so the month after I turned 18 I got Mirena put in ( no I had not had a kid yet). I took 2 advil before the appointment and the insertion felt like a very targeted cramp that lasted 5 seconds. I was on my feet in a minute and out the door driving in 5. I really do think it depends on your pain tolerance. My first period after was pretty regular if not maybe a little shorter and then I stopped having period all togeather. Mirena is a high dose hormone IUD so this can happen. I have had it for five years now. It didn't do anything for my acne. I definitely noticed some breast tenderness but it was sporadic. I am getting this one taking out and a new one in next week. I considered Kyleena but its lower dosing and I really liked not having a period these last five years. I am a little concerned about the removal pain.,

After a month of having my period (everyday) I didn’t get my period anymore. A year later, I had a dry cough for the next 2 years. Then in November of 2017 I noticed that my right arm was swollen, twice the size. I didn’t think anything of it so I proceeded to go to the gym & attempted to do a spin class. Within 5 minutes I started noticing shortness of breath. So I went to the emergency room & they did some tests & told me that I had a blood clot in my armpit & immediately went on blood thinners. They also told me that if I didn’t go to the hospital my heart could’ve stopped that week. A week later I got a CAT scan because my arm blew up again & they saw that I also had a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in my right lung). I was on blood thinners for 4 months (which made me severely depressed — couldn’t leave my bedroom) & have to now take baby aspirin everyday.

Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 30 months ago (8/17/2018),Report,"I do NOT recommend. I had it implanted on advice from a doctor. Kept for full five years because of cost and unsure that side effects experienced were related, as I was already a living a highly stressful life and doctors had no advice. Side effects included severe depression, severe mood swings, constant discharge and extended periods, sudden acne on chest and back, and cramping. Had to pay for dermatologist and oral contraceptive anyway in attempt to rid the acne. Almost lost my partner from my mood swings and loss of libido. Having been off it now for a couple of years, I can definitively say that Mirena caused the above symptoms and I regret not having it taken out sooner. It took at least a year to re-regulate my body. Terrible experience all around.",
Rated  for Endometriosis Report,Posted 30 months ago (8/17/2018),Report,"I got my first Mirena to treat suspected endometriosis pain and heavy periods. Besides having a difficult insertion that required ultrasound guidance (very retroverted uterus and crooked cervix), it was not really painful and I immediately stopped having periods within a week. It lasted about 3 1/2 years before I started getting spotting and cramping again. I just had it replaced (around 4 years total time since the first one was put in) and removal and insertion of the new one was essentially painless and so much easier than the first one. It has only been 6 hours and my cramps have already stopped after the insertion and I had mild spotting from the procedure for a couple hours, which has also stopped. I love my mirena and it's absolutely worth trying for anyone with severe periods and pain.",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 30 months ago (8/15/2018),Report,"I got the mirena as for me it sounded like the best option, not having to worry about it for 5 years and it has less hormones than the pill. Before I went in I had 2 ibprofen and an oxy. I got it in just as my period was ending as the cervix is generally a bit more dilated and to minimise bleeding. For background I am 21 with no kids. The procedure was fairly painless and just felt some slight cramping as the doctor put it in the cervix. The day I got it in (Monday) I couldn't get out of bed for around 5 hours after as it was just serious cramping which is normal and is your body adjusting, Day two was normal period like cramps and slight discharge. Day three (Today) no cramping and no discharge and feeling great. Don't be discouraged by one persons negative experience always try it out for yourself, you may love it and its not really a big deal to get it taken out if you don't. Top tips would be to get it at the end of your period so your cycle stays similar and to keep yourself from bleeding earlier than expected and stay relaxed! Make sure the cords are trimmed so you can only just feel them as my doctor left mine too long and I have to go in again to get them, trimmed.",

I had half of my thyroid removed 3 years ago and was very cautious about my TSH level. Before placing Mirena- it was 1.43, so perfectly fine! After 4 weeks of having Mirena i decided to check my TSH again and it jumped to 4.59! I was furious because all the doctors said that it shouldn’t affect my hormone level at all!

Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 31 months ago (7/24/2018),Report,"I have had the Mirena IUD inside of me for one year now, I am 34 years old, never had kids. My periods had been very light until last year. I originally got this IUD because my periods were getting very heavy and almost daily. After changing to different birth control pills nothing was working so the doctor suggested this IUD. She had lied to me and told me it was an easy procedure that wasn't painful. God, that was the most painful experience ever. I even yelped on the table as she was inserting and she told me to calm down. I managed to get a cab home and passed out from the pain. I was in pain for a few weeks after. It has been one year since I've had this thing in me and guess what, still bleeding, almost daily and my strings are lost. So another doctor recommended for me to keep it in for the ""benefits"" because trying to find my strings and removing it will cause more pain. I bleed so much and so often that my boyfriend this past year has lost interest in having sex with me. I will be getting it removed in the next month and hopefully will find something else to stop the bleeding.",

Having it inserted was uncomfortable and a little painful for sure but my gynecologist was amazing and she made it as quick and painless as possible. She prescribed 2 Motrin prior to coming to the appointment and I think that really helped. I had some minor cramping for about a week or two afterwards and I bled slightly on and off for about 2 months. Since then, I have to say I'm extremely happy with this product. I no longer have periods which is HUGE as I used to lose a lot of blood every month which drained me of energy. I was always tired and had to push myself to do anything. I've never been athletic but now I have the energy so I'm walking every day, started Yoga and started on a healthy Weight Watchers diet. I'm feeling healthier and more energetic than I've felt since my 30's! I've lost 15 lbs too which is obviously due to the diet and exercise but I don't know that I would have done any of this without the health benefits from the Mirena.

When I went to see a dermatologist she told me that she tells every patient of hers struggling w acne w Mirena that it will 1000% screw up your skin. I have friends on mirena who have flawless skin but if you’re prone to acne i would reccomend a pill instead of this. Not to mention, when I had it inserted I had unbearable cramps for weeks where I could barely get out of bed and bled for 4 months following the insertion. Also there would be weeks were I could literally feel the iud poking inside of my body which just felt like hell. Oh and don’t forget the 20 + pounds I gained!!! I’m also a person who deals with anxiety and depression, and this did not help. I had little will to do much. Only thing that stayed the same was my sex drive and even that was lacking.

Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 32 months ago (6/24/2018),Report,"My application experience was very similar to many other women. It was really painful and I had lots of cramping after. Next was the mood and the weight gain. I work out regularly and eat very clean yet I wasn't able to lose and I ended up gaining a few pounds. Over all I would describe myself as a go getter, ambitious, happy, healthy person and Mirena made me feel the complete opposite. I didn't want to clean my house, no ambition to work out, I was sad, some could say I seemed depressed. I made the choice of removing Mirena once and for all. I immediately started to feel better. My advice for women is to research Mirena and read all the reviews (the good and the bad) before investing in this decision. I've had friends that are using Mirena currently and it works for them like a charm. I myself did not have that success story.

For me the insertion wasn't painful, mild pressure and a bit of a pinch and it was done. I had about six months of irregular spotting while my body adjusted to the hormones. That was very difficult for me to deal with because I never knew when it would happen. In addition, during the first six months I had an increase in moodiness, depression, and anxiety. I felt like I was walking around in a fog. Around month eight, emotionally I felt numb. I was not able to achieve any kind of emotional up or down. It was like I was stuck. Physically I completely lost my sex drive. When I did have sex it took an incredibly long time to climax. I had the Mirena removed at a year under protest by my doctor. I was told that the Mirena couldn't possibly be the cause of my symptoms. About a month after removal I began to feel better emotionally and my sex drive returned. Mirena did not work out for me. I will say however the upside to Mirena is that it nearly eliminated my period. I was able to get by on pantiliners alone. That was not enough for me however to keep it in.",

I doubted it the first 6 months and seriously considered having it removed as there was random bleeding/spotting/discharge at different times and it was starting to affect my sex life, however, less than the bleeding issues that had plagued my life for so many years prior. Now 10 months in, I am glad I stuck it out. My periods are almost nonexistent (it is light spotting for the most part but lasts a bit longer at about just over a week, but I will take that over having to be confined to the house or go to the hospital and get blood transfusions and being half dead all the time!) Everyone said just stick it out for a bit, and I'm so far glad I did. I guess it's still relatively new so I will see how it pans out in the near future.

After a month, I went to a GYN specialist since I was panicked that I might have fibroids or uterine cancer. After many tests, they couldn't find anything wrong with me. The GYN recommended a Mirena to control my bleeding and I reluctantly agreed. The insertion was definitely not a pleasant experience, but I was desperate for a solution so gritted my teeth. After a few hours, I didn't have any pain, but continued to bleed and spot off and on for about a month. After that, all bleeding stopped and I didn't have any more bleeding until I had to have it removed 5 years later. It was wonderful freedom! However, getting another one was problematic since my prior GYN had retired. I have a tilted and curved uterus, so the new GYN had problems inserting.

Rated  for Contraception Report,Posted 33 months ago (5/20/2018),Report,I wanted to review this because I used Mirena for birth control about 12 years ago. I am now researching it for my adult daughter and realize that there are a lot of negative reviews so wanted to show a positive review. The insertion for me was a little uncomfortable but no more than an annual exam and PAP smear. I didn’t have any spotting or bleeding afterwards and after a few months my period stopped permanently. I do think I was a little sensitive to the hormone and in retrospect see that I had a small amount of acne due to this. I was very happy with this as a birth control as I never had to think about it. My OBGYN suggested to leave the strings long as it would be less likely to bother my partner. My only concern for my daughter is she does suffer from depression and hormones can make this worse. I am a little concerned about some people reporting anxiety also. That is why I’m not relying fully on my good experience and researching others experiences.,

Within 6 months I barley had a period. 2nd time I’m 2.5 yrs in and it’s just now starting to slow down and become lighter. No discomfort either times, just dissappointed because I was expecting no periods to now having one every 28 days. And now this past month it became lighter and a little shorter, but I’ve gain spotting days in between. So that kinda stinks. Not sure what will happen next, it will probably diminish by the time it needs to be replaced and I will have to start all over again.",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 34 months ago (4/29/2018),Report,"I have had Mirena for almost 5 years now (I am 25) it has been a blessing! Getting it inserted was probably the worst pain I have ever felt in my life (and I have tattoos) but other than that it has been great. I have had no problems, but of course there are always people trying to talk me out of it and make me paranoid, so I always check my Mirena 1-2 times a year. I did have a friend who only had Mirena for 2 years before having to taken out due to discomfort; so it is not for everyone. But I love it! I will be changing mine out soon for a new one!",

The time that it takes me to reach orgasm has doubled or tripled... on this reason alone i am thinking of getting it removed. Everything else is fine really... although it might be causing mood related symptoms... hard to know for sure as you know that is part of life too. But for sure i think this has affected my ability to reach orgasm!!!,

Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 34 months ago (4/19/2018),Report,*INSERTION ONLY REVIEW* I wanted a birth control method with less hormones than the pill and it will be nice not to have to worry about taking the pill everyday. My doctor gave me a prescription for Cytotec to insert the night before the procedure to dilate/soften my cervix since I have never had children. The day of procedure I took a 800mg ibuprofen beforehand. Overall it took about 5 minutes from start to finish and I experienced some slight pain similar to a menstrual cramp and some cramping the rest of the day. Today is 2 days post insertion and I haven’t had to use any pain killers at all. My doctor said I will likely bleed/spot but so far nothing..overall my insertion experience was easy and I’m glad many of these reviews saying it was excruciating pain did not scare me away from going through with it. I will post again when I can have a review for the Mirena itself!,

For about 6 months I experienced bleeding and major cramps on a biweekly basis. I did go back to my doctor the implant was in place and she asked me to stick it out a little longer and to see if it got better. (She was positive that it would) Well a year in I was still bleeding and cramping. It did start to lesson after that, so against my better judgment I kept on with it. Every time that my husband and I had sex, I would start cramping and bleeding again. This obviously put a strain on our marriage. However I also started to gain a lot of weight, acne was worse, I experienced major migraines that were debilitating, and had major mood swings. After 2 years of all of this I decided to have it removed. Once removed my husband and I started trying for another baby, 6 years later we finally were pregnant. 6 YEARS (fertility doctors, treatments, diets, hormones, etc) I still to date have problems with the weight, and hormones.",

Nevertheless, totally worth another half decade of not worrying. After the first year i had no libido. Like at all. I was no longer attracted to anyone and had no sexual response whatsoever. I had extreme vaginal dryness too. Unfortunately i chalked this all up to depression, which i was also experiencing. Not until i started searching online, and found 100s of women describing exactly the same thing did i realize that it was my IUD. It has been 18 months since i had it removed and it has taken over a year to start to feel like myself again.

Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 36 months ago (2/18/2018),Report,"I'm 21 years old, nearly at the two week mark so can only review the immediate effects. Prior to the procedure, I didn't take any painkillers. As a result, it was one of the most painful experiences of my life- so TAKE PAINKILLERS! Although, even with painkillers I'm sure it would have been hell. It honestly felt like someone was injecting my womb from the inside with a thick, blunt needle. I bled very heavily as soon as the procedure was over, and experienced a few hours of severe cramps. I have been bleeding pretty much non stop, it has picked up in the past few days. But my cramps have pretty much stopped. You can tell it's bleeding caused by Mirena because the blood is bright red. Right now I'm hoping the bleeding will stop with the month. I feel Doctors don't stress enough the extent to which you will bleed after this is inserted.","I’ve never been pregnant and have never had any problems down there and getting Mirena installed was nearly painless for me, not nearly as painful as some reviews I’ve read online before I got it. It feels just like menstrual cramps and the insertion process is very quick. I had a pap smear and the IUD installed all in under 5 minutes. Continued cramping for the couple days following, but nothing some Ibuprofen can’t take care of. Great experience so far."

Facial hair previously disappeared now seems to be growing all over the place and I've been in to be lasered twice. My mood? OMG - mood swings from anger to depression and a MASSIVE craving for sugar. Oh and the cramping.

I had extreme hair loss :( some times even when not bleeding or spotting, i get cramps out of no where that feel like contractions.

Rated  for Endometriosis Report,Posted 37 months ago (1/28/2018),Report,"I had the Mirena IUD as a penultimate treatment for adenomyosis in October 2016. The benefits were bleeding and clotting were reduced by around 60%, also period pain was significantly reduced. The side effects were, however, considerable and far outweighed any advantages. Most notable were, progressive hair loss, profuse discharge, low level daily cramping, severe bloating and flatulence. On medical advice I persevered with the iud on the hope that these side effects would dissipate, however, it would appear that the side effects in my case multiplied and became increasingly unmanageable. The additional side effects that developed throughout the final 9-12 months included increasingly blurred vision, joint pain (akin to arthritis) depression and severe anxiety. Unlike many other medications that I use long term it would appear that in my case the negative effects of the Mirena became more marked as treatment continued most notable was the considerable hair loss and anxiety. A disappointing and difficult experience to navigate, especially when coupled with an existing chronic pain condition.",

I called the gynecologist every couple months and they said it was normal and to give it a couple more months and they said my periods would be lighter and shorter as they became more regular. So I waited and waited and it didn't stop for a year and a half! And when it did stop I started having the most painful sex ever in my life! And after numerous doctor appts I finally got a CT scan that showed ovarian cysts. Once a cyst would pop there would already be another one on my other ovary. This went on for about 6 months because the doctor couldn't figure out what was going on at first then had to switch my birth control.

Panty liners and or tampons are still required daily. In three days it will be 5 weeks.

In less than a week I went from making more than enough milk to none at all. It was very uncomfortable and painful. I ended up going to the hospital to have it removed 7 days after it was put in and they told me that some of the pain was due to it moving farther into the uterus than it should be. Turns out that when you breasfeed its more likely to trigger contractions which in my case sucked it farther in.

She had to have one of her filopian tubes removed and her baby aborted during finals week of our senior year of college. This is something the doctors fail to share with you as a “side effect”. Even though this tragedy happened, I was still screwing up my pill and having consistent sex with a new boyfriend. Sometimes we wanted to share a moment together and not have him pull out, this didn’t feel like something I could risk doing on the pill but IUDs are supposed to be much more protective. I was also experiencing a lot of mood swings from I think not taking the pill properly (on top of a whole other array of life things though as well). My PMS and flow was also very heavy so I felt like half of every month was committed to just getting through my period. I decided it was probably time to test out the IUD impulsively one day.

I’m a fairly active person and haven’t had issues with losing weight if a few pounds popped up here and there, but it’ll been a struggle for the past few years. I just chalked it up to getting older but after reading reviews I’m starving to think it was the Mirena. I’ve been off it for a week and I’m already noticing a loss of bloat (looking bloated) even with the light spotting expected after removal. I’ve also had a weird underarm smell (not BO) that has been a struggle for the past few years and I thought it was my diet or vitamin deficiency; but 1 week without Mirena and it’s subsided. If you get this, be aware if changes in your body. Mine didn’t happen overnight but was more a gradual progression of symptoms where I wouldn’t think, “this must be the Mirena”. You forget it’s there and assume it has to be something you’ve introduced to your body recently. Look at older blogs and reviews from people who have been on it for over a couple of years. There a",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 38 months ago (12/15/2017),Report,"Hello! I have just had my Mirena inserted and I just wanted to let you know what the process was like. My doctor gave me temazepam to have the night before and the morning of the procedure. It helps you and your muscles to relax. The actual procedure was quite quick and not very painful, just a bit uncomfortable. I've never been pregnant, so my uterus was not happy being prodded. But it felt more like a menstrual cramp than anything really painful. My doctor also put local anasthetic into my uterus/cervix area to help it to relax. She does this with all her patients, but says some doctors don't do this. All in all, I would say that if the idea of insertion is holding you back, it's really not too bad. Try to relax, as tensing up can make it harder to insert. Also, you can ask your doctor to have a look at your cervix at your consultation appointment to ensure that you won't have too much trouble with insertion. Hope this helps! Will let you know how I go with side effects etc in future. :)",

I would get my regular period every month which I don’t mind. After maybe 6months of having it I would have light bleeding like pinkish color blood after sex and my bf would always ask me are u on ur period? I wasn’t... I would always brushed it off ok so now it’s been 1 1/2 that I have it.I started getting pain in my elbow my arm would get numb at night so 5 months later that’s when everything started. I started to have uti and yeast infection doctors would give me antibiotics after antibiotics for 3 months u name it i got tested for everything all negative.Until finally I decided to take out my iud.I was like this has to be this whats affecting me.So when I came to take it out doctor couldn’t take it out so I had to get ultrasound done come to find out the Mirena is not where is supposed to be so now I’m schedule for a procedure to take out ouch! I had all kind of side affect my hair fell out like crazy, acne, depression, anxiety, sluggish I hated it I wouldn’t go back. It didn’t work for me.","I stared using Mirena 8 months ago after trying every other contraceptive. I’ve got 2 kids and my boyfriend and I were not ready to have another.

I did experience some cramping that day but nothing else till my next period, honestly the first 3-4 months aren’t easy... I had regular spotting and mild flows every now and then, some cramping too, but nothing unbearable. After that initial 3-4 months ( which I was warned about) I can without a doubt say that it is the best contraceptive I’ve ever used.

However, it was a piece of cake for me. I do not have a high threshold for pain either. It was literally a few minutes. One uncomfortable twinge and the rest of the procedure was fast and painless. It's only been a day but I had NO cramping or pain afterwards. I did take three aleve before the procedure and tried very hard to relax during the insertion which is always hard in that position. I was prescribed this because I am in perimenopause and have heavy heavy bleeding that lasts about a month each cycle resulting in low hemoglobin / iron infusions and the occasional blood transfusion. Hoping this stops or lightens my cycle which is the goal. Good luck to everybody. Don't read all of the reviews of pain associated with the insertion.

I took pain relievers beforehand and tried to remind myself to take deep breaths. Sitting up afterwords was worse for me. I felt like I was going to pass out and had to lay down for about 10 minutes. I planned for my boyfriend to drive me home after reading other reviews. I took it easy the rest of the day with a heating pad. I had cramps for a few hours and spotted during those hours. Since then I have stopped bleeding which feels like a miracle. I used Nexplanon for 3 years and a half years. The last six months on Nexplanon I bled non-stop (light but non-stop.) Without birth control my periods are really long and super heavy to the point that I become anemic. I cannot use anything with estrogen after having stroke symptoms (and migraines) on the pill.

You do need a pain killer before and after, which my doctor did not warn me about. I have been experiencing mild cramping occasionally since and very light spotting after sex (I had sex 3 days after having it inserted and the iud caused no problems there). I have had zero other side effects so far. I got the iud because I can't remember the pill and have way too many side effects on the patch and do not handle shots well. I plan to keep mine and so far all seems well and I like it as far as birth control goes. I just wanted to point out that if you are considering this option understand and take into account it could hurt, and it could hurt badly. Nobody warned me of this.

I had severe cramping during the first 3 days, which was expected. I continued to have irregular bleeding for about 4 months, but have read that that too is quite normal. Now I no longer bleed, nor do I have any cramping, which is wonderful. The only side effect I seem to have is that my breasts have been getting bigger and that they become incredibly sensitive at least 1x/month. They rarely used to get hard and painful like this....and I am not yet sure if I like it. I really hope they return to normal.

Insertion was painful but so quick that it’s completely tolerable considering I’m a pretty squeamish person; I went to work right after and was fine with the Advil they recommended. I’ve never had a child or been pregnant and the pain for me was still not bad. Also, the cramps afterwards are nothing compared to the ones I used to have without BC. The only annoying thing is the constant spotting for me but this will more than likely go away completely so I feel like it’s not a big deal compared to the side effects I had on the pill. I actually ended up losing weight on mirena because I think my previous pill was making me gain weight. And my emotions are finally stable since it doesn’t mess much with your head, yay!

I actually need a hysterectomy, but Kaiser has a love affair with Mirena, so they force you to get one before surgery. I’m taking it to treat PCOS and anemia. I’m in increasingly worse pain that is keeping me awake. I would RUN from this. I absolutely am getting this out immediately. Yay for those of you that like it, but shame on Kaiser for forcing this on women. I would tell you not to get it if you have any kind of uterine issue.

Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 40 months ago (10/20/2017),Report,"Unfortunately the Mirena was not for me. Although it was awesome my period went away completely, the side effects were too much and I had it removed and replaced with the Paraguard copper IUD after only four months. The Mirena caused rapid, unexplainable weight gain, my acne came back after years of no acne, sex drive diminished to nothing, and I felt depressed and sluggish. It's only been a week with the new copper IUD but I already feel like the non-hormonal option was better for me. I have multiple friends who have had an awesome experience with Mirena, so I wouldn't count it out completely. It just caused lots of side effects for me, that I never experienced while on the pill for 10+ years. It was also very painful to put in, and was much more painful than the Paraguard.",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 40 months ago (10/18/2017),Report,I am on my 3rd IUD. I first got the Meraina in 2007. Every 5 years I have had it replaced. This is my 3rd one. Prior to going and having it replaced I take mydole. I get minimum cramping during the replacement. I love the IUD. I bleed for the first 24 hours after not much then I never bleed again. I have not had a true period in 10 years. I have not had any spotting or anything. I would recommend that you ask your gyn after your follow up to cut the strings. I have mine cut just even with my cervix. They were bothering my husband. Love it. 1 every 6 years now I can suffer some mild pain.,

I had my Mirena IUD placed yesterday, so my review will be soley based on the procedure. I was told that it was best to have the Mirena inserted during my period because the uterus is softer so I had mine inserted on day 2 of my period. The procedure took around 5 minutes and I do have a high pain tolerance and I would say it was slightly painful, but nothing that I wasn't able to handle. I did have instant cramping the second the tools touched my uterus. After the procedure, my doctor gave me another 300mg of Ibuprofen and I was fine, only slight cramping. I asked how long I had to wait until I could work out, could I use a tampon? She said absolutely NO restrictions, I can work out right away and even have sex since it's effective immedately and yes to a tampon. I drove myself to work after, was able to work the entire day, went grocery shopping afterwards, lifted 2 cases of water into my cart and into my car, no problems. Woke up the next day feeling great, no cramping, no pain, no nothing so far.",

It's not perfect but the main reason I wanted it was to prevent pregnancy and it has saved me a lot of anxiety. The insertion was very painful for me, I could have taken more Advil prior. I usually have bad cramps so the insertion was a lot of cramping which lasted a couple days. But it's been so long it's just a memory now rather than a nightmare. No acne, no weight gain, no mood changes. I do get PMS a little bit more now, moody for a week and my breasts get pretty tender/swollen. But it is bearable. I still get my period for 5-8 days every month with moderate cramping. I've always had cramps but they are way more tolerable now. Not sure if this happens for many others, but I did have cramping after sex in the first couple of months but now that only seems to happen if I have sex while on my period. Would recommend to anyone who has access to this birth control. It's great knowing how protected you are (for 5 years!) and there is no daily effort to ensure how effective it is.

I've had it for about 6 months now, I don't get a period anymore, I get significantly fewer migraines (which is a blessing), and I don't get night sweats anymore.

I got it put in on a Friday so I could camp out on the couch the next two days, which I highly reccomend. After that, I was taking Advil every day for about two weeks for moderate cramping.

Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 42 months ago (8/15/2017),Report,I got the mirena about 2 weeks ago. Yes I'm aware it's a little too early to review but I wanted to share. Insertion went fine! Done in about 2 minutes. Cramping was tolerable for me because I suffer from horrible menstrual cramps. So it was nothing compared to what I dealt with. The dr said I would feel dizzy or nauseated but I didnt. I actually went grocery shopping afterwards lol. I had no cramping or bleeding the first week. 2nd week I had light spotting for a day but it was seriously barely noticeable. My only problem with it is my lower back hurts from time to time and my husband says he can feel it during sex and it's uncomfortable. Other than that there's no problems with it,

I was terrified walking into my gyno to get mine. However, it was NOT painful at all! If anything, it was just 30 seconds of an uncomfortable feeling. No pain at all. After the procedure, I almost fainted and was very clammy. About 30 minutes later I was perfectly fine again. I had light cramps for the next week but with a little advil I couldn't feel them at all.

This is my story without sugar coating. I had Mirena inserted in December 2016, so it's been about 9 months. I haven't had children, so insertion was very painful for me and I had a vasovagal response that made my blood pressure drop low, to where I almost fainted. It took about a week for the insertion cramps to subside. I had some bad cramping for the first few months whenever I would ovulate and my period was pretty unpredictable. I have been on the pill (I think it was off brand Yaz) for years to control my heavy periods and acne problems. Unfortunately, the Mirena doesn't help with my acne. My periods are much lighter than they were on the pill, but are still unpredictable. I have gained a lot of weight while on Mirena. I was exactly watching what I ate though. I just have to be more careful with my diet than I have been in the past. All that being said, I feel like it is worth it. Being a college student, my schedule is all over the place.

Periods were frequent, however, they were light and it was still better than having to wear an adult diaper for the heavy bleeding I had before. It also increased my libido and lubrication, making intercourse even better. Fast forward 5 years to age 46 when I had the Mirena replaced. Gynecologist had trouble inserting it because of ""scar tissue"" in my cervix. After trying several times it was finally in. I went home and it felt like my vagina was swollen. I thought it was simply because she had trouble getting the IUD inserted and irritated things in there. Well, it's been 7 months and the swelling seems to still be there as well as a growing abdomen.

The downside however is although my most recent periods have only be two to three days, the cramping is worse and more concentrated than it was before my IUD (less of a throb more of a jab).

Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 43 months ago (7/15/2017),Report,"I tried Mirena back in 2007, after 1yr of having my daughter. It fell out of place then. I am 29 and I have it another chance after experiencing horrible side effects from Blisovi24 BC pills. I got it placed 3/2017. Insertion was painful. I was on pain pills for a week, and I have a high tolerance for pain. Almost immediately, period gone completely with no spotting. I often get cramping and since have gained 20lbs. Family have asked if I am pregnant, because the bloat is serious. I am getting it removed because it swells my feet, gained weight, hair loss (even cut my hair), and cramping+bloating. However, it is super effective in preventing pregnancy. Also been told that after removal, it take a long time to be able to get pregnant. I hate periods but it's a normal process of life, plus how else are you to know that you are pregnant?? I hate the foreign objected feeling in my pelvic area, constant cramping as well. I tried all birth controls except the norplant and shot. Think I will just go without, because they ALL give me side effects that are undesirable.",

I can't comment on the long term effects as I only had mine put in one day ago. The procedure was excruciatingly painful and I felt nauseous and dizzy after.

My friend also got the mirena and warned me about weight gain. I actually lost weight while I had the mirena but I was really concerned that I was becoming moody because of the hormones. The plus is that my periods vanished so I was pleased, but bc of concerns of moodiness, I removed it in 2014 and switched to the copper IUD. When I took the mirena out I bled like I was dying. I had clotting the size of golf balls and I would bleed heavy for 7-9 days length of periods. It was horrible. Still with the copper IUD my period cycles were so heavy I would wear a tampon with pads meant for bladder control issues- regular pads were not cutting it. I would have to change every two hours. Then I became severely anemic. Hemoglobin dropped to a 6. Started taking iron went up to an 8, but still the periods weee causing me to get yeast infections bc i was losing too much blood. In 2017, I took the copper IUD out and put the mirena back in. Looking forward to lighter and non existent periods again to counteract against all the turmoil I've been experiencing the past three years.",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 43 months ago (7/14/2017),Report,"I waited for months to get the Mirena because after reading all the reviews about the insertion process I was super scared. I finally sucked it up and did it. I did not take ibuprofen before insertion, but I did take some after to help with the cramps. And btw the insertion isn't as bad as most of these reviews state. Yes you experience a big menstrual cramp, but it's seriously over in two seconds. It's not comfortable, but it's not horrible. Basically the way I view it is suck it up for two seconds and don't deal with pills or shots for 5 whole years. So worth the cramps. I did have cramping for probably 4 hours fmafter insertion, but nothing crazy. Just regular menstrual cramps. Don't be scared. Trust me you'll make it through and you'll be super happy you did. 5 years of birth control freedom.",

My experience getting it inserted was good, even though I was quite nervous from hearing some bad stories.

My gynecologist had a long, thin, ruler-type thing that she had to move around inside my uterus to measure it for the insertion. I had one sharp, quick pain from like, like a needle prick. Then she put in a cervix clamp to hold open my cervix so that she could get the IUD in. I'm 31 and have no children so my cervix is not very open. The clamp to me felt like when your cervix is swabbed for a Pap smear, so it was uncomfortable but not painful. Then the clamp fell off (my strong cervix!) and had to be re-clamped. Then she tried to put in the IUD and the opening wasn't big enough for it to go through. That was also uncomfortable and mildly painful, I could feel the poking/pushing against my cervix. She put on another clamp to open up my cervix more and again tried to put in the IUD, felt more poking/pressure and then felt it go into the uterus.

It was great, my fiancé couldn't feel it and I totally forgot it was there! Then a week ago I got SEVERE stabbing pain on my left pelvic region, so painful that I couldn't move or walk and was in tears. I ended up in the ER and after blood draws, ultrasounds and a CT scan it was determined that I have a cyst on my left ovary. While the emergency room doctor couldn't say for sure that it was caused from the IUD, he said it most likely was due to me never having any issues with pain like this or a history of cysts. I was on oxycodone for the pain and missed 5 days of work. I had a heating pad on me 24/7 and all I felt was severe pain, sharp, pinching and pressure. I went to my obgyn today to have it removed, it cramped for a second when she removed it and immediately I felt great! All that pressure and discomfort was gone immediately.

I tried to remember that people are more likely to review from a negative experience, so maybe I was missing all the positives.

So I made my appointment. I was still very nervous, but my dr talked me through it. The pinch he said would happen when they grab hold of the cervix really didn't feel like a pinch to me, when they measured my cervix I felt one cramp and the worst of the cramping came when inserting the mirena, but that went very fast and it was no worse than cramping during my period.

I had it placed yesterday afternoon by my ObGYN and he walked me through everything that was going to happen, swab the cervix, then measure the depth of my uterus (which to me was the worst part) and then the placement of the IUD. My pain level was probably at about a 5/6 and lasted only a few seconds. After it was complete, I layed on the table for about 5 to 10 mins and then was free to leave. During the evening hours, I would have some discomfort walking, but nothing more than regular monthly cramps. Spotting is still present since it has only been 24 hours since the procedure. Today there is not much spotting, just even to use a pantiliner and the cramps are more annoying than painful. Take 600 mgs of ibuprofen before your appointment and that will help greatly afterwards.

I liked the idea of the mirena because you don't have to do anything like remembering to take the pill & it was free with my insurance. It's also apparently incredibly effective (comparable to getting your tubes tied). But, I read lots of reviews and the negative ones claiming that it was incredibly painful really freaked my out. I also read a couple horror stories about very rare complications. It wasn't until a couple friends of mine got the mirena put in that I decided to get it. My friends both hated it at first (one passed out from the pain of the insertion and they both had cramping and didn't feel well for the first month of having it put in) but after about a month passed they both raved about how much they loved it and how worth it it was. One friend took it for contraception and the other got it to help with painful periods. I talked with my doctor who told me that the pain really isn't too bad (she had one) and said complicati",

Like w weird magician pulling a small ribbon out of my vagina. It should be noted, I have an EXTREMELY LOW tolerance fore pain. I scream and cry at Pap smears, I cried and screamed and cursed when I got my stitches taken out, I collapse on the floor and weep when I burn myself cooking, but this was really, truly nothing. Afterwards I had a small amount of cramping for a few hours, like the kind of framing where you're either nervousness or you might have to poop.

Most reassuring was that she had inserted over 10k and has one inserted herself.

In about 5 minutes the procedure was complete. Have a nurse hold your hand and have the dr explain everything that is happening. I took 4 Advil when I got home and I have had very mild spotting. you will need to go back for a follow up in 2 weeks and then again in a month to have an ultrasound to ensure the unit is in place.

Rated  for Contraception Report,Posted 47 months ago (3/31/2017),Report,"I got my Mirena removed today after 6 months with it. I should preface this with I have a very low pain tolerance. The insertion was terrible for me, and was pretty darn crampy for the following week. After the first few weeks, the pain and bloating got much better, but I'd had pretty much constant abdominal pain since insertion. Severity ranging from mild to moderate. I got about 3 ovarian cysts in that time, one of them rupturing. In the 6 years I was on the pill I had only gotten 1, and thats because I was misusing it. I feel for me, personally, I had the constant abdominal pain because I also have a tense pelvic floor (which I'm going to PT for) and I feel my pelvic floor muscles just didn't take too well to having a foreign object in there to squeeze. I also kept getting BV, which I'd never had before. I've read other stories of women who kept getting BV and yeast infections with an IUD.

I got the Mirena put in 2 days ago. I was nervous and so scared because of all the bad reviews I read about it before I went to have it put in. While getting the Mirena put in there were 3 cramps, each cramp were worse than the other but none were unbearable. Once the Mirena was put in, they did an ultra sound to be sure that it was in place and my doctor said everything looked great. I went back to work after I got it put in, I was tired and a little uncomfortable for the rest of the day. I went home and slept for most of the afternoon. Yesterday was by far the hardest day, I had cramps on and off, I was dizzy, and I was spotting on and off. But, none of this was super painful. My boyfriend and I had sex last night, my doctor told us to use condoms for the first month because the strings will be scratchy for a little bit. We used a condom and he could only feel the strings in certain positions. Sex was not painful and I did not bleed bad",

Reading some of the reviews actually made me a little freaked out about the pain. While the doctor did offer to inject my cervix with lidocaine, I declined due to my fear of needles and the fact that I would feel 4 pinches instead of one tug. The process wasn't as painful as I expected it to be, although it was still painful. As some women have said, it feels like you're getting cramps, but you get used to it after a minute. The whole process lasted about 6 minutes. When the doctor removed all the tools, a gush of blood came out which is perfectly normal, I was surprised at how much came out. Afterwards, I felt no pain, it was just during the process. I still feel no pain and if it wasn't for the fact that I'm still spotting, I would've forgotten I had it inserted.

I took a Percocet 45 mins before my appointment but I don't think it did much for the pain. I asked my doc about a cervical block, but she said that it would actually hurt worse and take longer and that it's mostly used by less experienced doctors. She said while prepping me that I should've been given misoprostol the night before but 'oh well, we'll try our best' (not scary at all right before insertion..)

I am studying abroad this semester and traveling a lot and it is so nice to not have to worry about my period or remember to take the pill everyday. I also used to get really bad mood swings during PMS but that completely went away. All bodies are different but I'm so glad I took the leap of faith with an IUD- I'll never go back to any other form of birth control.

Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 48 months ago (2/27/2017),Report,"I have had Mirena in for 1.5 years now, and this is a mixed review for me. Note: I have had two Paragard IUD's in before Mirena because I don't like taking any hormones. First off most my friends recommended I get it out almost immediately after telling them I got it in. Three of our friends got pregnant on Mirena and all suffered from severe weight gain. I was educated later that majority of pregnancies on IUD's is either from improper insertion or because it has shifted. The weight gain I wasn't really concerned about because it's never been an issue before so I left it in. At first really all I had to complain about was some acne issue like boils,but I got with Paragard as well, so it was 'meh' to me. I also had to deal with medium to light flow period for 12 day, but after the Paragard's 21 day super heavy flow periods it was nothing. Soon the acne cleared up, and the periods shortened to 9 days of light flow. Sadly in the last fours months with the Mirena there have been some major side effects.

I still have semi normal periods and cramping but that doesn't bother me so much. The placement of the IUD was painful I recommend eating before you get it put in. The pain didn't last long and spotted that day and that was it. The only side effect I have experienced was dramatic breast size increase. I went from a 34C to 36DD in just four months. I don't know if anyone else has experienced this or not and I know it effects everyone differently. I also had some nipple tenderness at the beginning but that is also normal. I have not experienced any weight gain or loss. I have not had a child so my placement of the IUD was more painful than those who have. If you have not had a child I would possibly recommend skyla because it is smaller and a little more flexible than mirena. But personally I do not have a problem with mine.,
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 48 months ago (2/22/2017),Report,"I decided to get Mirena because I had incredibly heavy periods, plus I wanted birth control after having my baby. In the first 6 months after insertion I bled for 2.5-3 weeks of the month, albeit lightly. It was frustrating, because I felt like all it did was replace a one 5-day heavy period for a slow trickle over a longer period of time. After about 6-7 months of that, my periods eventually tapered off, but would still last up to 2 weeks, but were minimal enough, I could just use liners and didn't need tampons. So, if you have heavy periods like me, then realize it may take several months for you to get to no or minimal periods. I just had it taken out due to other medical issues, and immediately started the heaviest period I had had in YEARS. Basically, I used to have really heavy periods all the way in to my 30s, but they had become somewhat more manageable on my late 30s, then tapered off a bit more after childbirth, and now I'm having my worst period since my early 30s at the age of 44, plus cramping, which I also hadn't had on years.

I hate going to the gyn (or any dr. for that matter), but a good, informative, and supportive doctor can make a world of difference. The process is uncomfortable and takes about 5-10 minutes I'd say.. First the speculum goes in, they did an internal ultrasound to make sure my uterus looked good, then they clean your cervix, then dilate it, then insert the IUD. The dilation and insertion is the most painful, but wasn't unbearable. The doctor sympathized and encouraged me and told me to wiggle my toes. I actually had a student putting it in, but she did it fast and on the first try while the doctor watched. I was in a lot of pain for maybe 30 seconds before the student was like ""It's in!"" and I'm like ""Really?!"" and I was VERY glad to be done. As soon as she took the speculum out a lot of the excruciating cramps disappeared. I think the process would have been a lot worse if I didn't have such a supportive doctor.

Took 3 ibuprofens before going to the clinic. Asked the doctor how much the pain would be on a scale of 1-10 and she said a 9. Which scared me of course. But anyways, the only bad part of it was that since I'm only 21 and haven't had any kids, my cervix would not open up at first. The pain, I would rate it a 7. But trust me it is bearable. Almost passed out when they tried to open up my cervix but that's about it. It's not all that scary. Very little bit of bleeding now because of the cervix not opening up but the pain after is exactly like period cramps. Overall I do recommend. Don't let the scary reviews scare you away!!","I'm a little confused by all of these horror stories. I've had Mirena for about 3 months now. I was having irregular bleeding for 90 days... No one could figure out why. Mirena stopped the bleeding dead in its tracks. I've had 1 period since which lasted a little longer than usual. I should have started a period this week but it was mild spotting for 3 days and now I'm back to normal. As far as the side effects, I was very hormonal for about 2 weeks around a month and a half after insertion. I was either depressed or angry or sad. That has subsided as well. The pain during insertion is very uncomfortable, however I had a c-section, so that is to be expected.

I was having irregular bleeding for 90 days... No one could figure out why. Mirena stopped the bleeding dead in its tracks. I've had 1 period since which lasted a little longer than usual. I should have started a period this week but it was mild spotting for 3 days and now I'm back to normal. As far as the side effects, I was very hormonal for about 2 weeks around a month and a half after insertion. I was either depressed or angry or sad. That has subsided as well. The pain during insertion is very uncomfortable, however I had a c-section, so that is to be expected.

I did the worst thing you could possibly do and read all the bad reviews and horror stories before I went in today. So I was expecting it to be a really bad experience. It wasn't. I am 42, have had two children and have been on birth control pills for years. My periods are heavy, clumpy, and I have very bad cramps. So this IUD was recommended to me. I took 800mg of Motrin before the procedure. I think the anticipation was worse then the actual procedure. My Dr talked me through it while the nurse held my hand. There is sharp cramps and a couple of pinches. Then it's done. I did get a headache when I sat up so I laid down for a bit and had some water. My husband and I went to lunch afterwards and then I slept for a couple of hours. I've had cramping and very light bleeding. Since I've only received it today, I'm not sure what future effects will be like but just wanted to comment on my thoughts about the insertion.",

My husband & I tried for 7 yrs for a child with no luck so we decided that as I was turning 45 I would start on birth control because we are at the point now where we are concerned about the risks of pregnancy at this age. I was on the pill yrs ago & had no issues but my gynecologist said that the iud was a better & safer choice at my age. I was very nervous after reading all of the negative reviews but the Insertion was not as bad as I expected. She did have a harder time placing it on me than most because I've had 2 LEEP procedures in my life & there was scar tissue as a result so it took longer then it probably should have for placement but nothing terrible. Felt a pinch & some pressure & some cramping but nothing that was intolerable. I took 400 mg of ibuprofen right before the appt. Being on my period during insertion was recommended by my gynecologist so the cramping I felt during & after was nothing worse then being on my period. I'm 3 hrs in & the cramping is gone. I just feel some pressure & a little bloated. I can't speak for side effects or how my period will be as a result because I've not been on it,

For one year, we never used a condom and had no problems. I lightly spotted for four weeks after the insertion and then never had a period after that. It was great because I didn't have to worry about taking the pill - and I always forgot to take the pill before. So the carefree birth control seemed like a great option. But then about three months after I got Mirena put in, I noticed my hair was coming out more in the shower. Chunks of hair would fall out when I brushed my hair or even scratched my head. My hair is now about 1/3 the thickness it use to be - and because I have such fine hair to begin with, it doesn't leave me with much at all. So I decided to get it take out. I got it out four days ago - and that was even more painful than getting it in. The gyno couldn't get a firm grasp on it and tried to pull it out six times before she was successful - an even at that she had to use the largest speculum I've ever experienced. Awful.

The pain of insertion was horrific. I knew that was going to happen, but I didn't expect to have random returns of that same pain for months afterward. I would be at work and just double over with extreme, incapacitating pain. It only lasted about a minute but its utterly incapacitating. I also broke out in severe, painful chest and back acne that would not respond to anything topical. We are talking huge, painful pimples. I've never had acne.

The insertion was not nearly as painful as everyone makes it out to be, it was almost nothing more then your average pap smear. The mirena works 100% to preventing pregnancy, so yes, it does fulfill it's primary purpose. However, I've been getting a lot of yeast infections and I'm lead to believe it's from the mirena even though my doctor swears it's impossible. I've gotten two ovarian cysts definitely from the mirena. My period has been slim to nothing and mirena was able to provide that to me like no other birth control could.

Also I constantly craved sugar, and found my sex drive dwindling. Many of the reviews I have read are by women who struggled with these symptoms for months and even years.

I haven't had a period since October of 2012 and very little side effects. Maybe some mood swings and discharge here and there but nothing major.

YES I definitely plan to get another inserted after this one because I'm not ready for another child.

This is the exact reason I wanted to write a review. I've had the Mirena in for over 6 months now and it has been an excellent experience. My mood swings subsided, libido went up (normalised) and my only negative side effect has been small pimples appearing on my chest at around the time of my period. I haven't had a proper period since the insertion, it's not even a day of very light spotting now. This has been a revelation for someone who had heavy 7 day periods previously. The insertion is uncomfortable but not awful - think a pinchy pap smear. I have never had children, apparently it hurts a bit more if you haven't had your cervix stretched.

I was 26, no children, and I missed my period (preferred time of insertion due to the dilation of cervix) by about a week. So going in, my blood pressure nose dived and I felt nauseous. My factor did congratulate me on not passing out or throwing up, which are both apparently common. After insertion, for about two months, I cramped (the uterus is trying to reject a foreign object, so yeah, some of the cramps were very painful) and spotted. Which was annoying and it made me want to call the whole thing off, but I persevered. And it was fantastic. My periods were never heavy before, and now they are practically non-existent. When I get periods, and some months I don't, it is mild spotting which is easily maintained by wiping when I use the restroom. I rarely use tampons anymore for my periods, so I guess I technically free-bleed, but again, it is super light and it rarely ever leaks onto my panties.

I was diagnosed with having high prolactin, most likely due to pituitary growth/lesion.

Now I hold 0-2 pounds, and I don’t feel bloated much during my cycle anymore.

No spotting at all after the period is done, unlike the pill. No remembering to take it at exactly a certain time. So far, I have noticed it’s made sex incredible, definitely notice stronger/longer orgasms. Still a chance my periods may go away or lighten, as I have heard it takes several months before they start to get noticeably lighter. So if you can bear out the first week, it’s probably worth it.

I had it placed at my 6 week post-pardem appointment and here I am 5 years later to have it removed. I don't remember the insertion being painful but then again I had a c-section and didnt take any pain pills after the hospital meds wore off because it was bearable (so I'm thinking I have a high pain tolerance). My husband did say he could feel the poking of the strings during sex so my doctor clipped them a little. My periods were extremely light, only needed a panty liner and lasted 3 to 5 days. Some months I never got a period. I can't say there are any significant side effects that I can relate to the Mirena. I've had a very positive experience with it. Several of my friendsister is it as well and also love it. Everyone's body is different so you have to find what works best for you. Good luck!",

I used my phone during the insertion as a distraction. And much to my surprise, it did not hurt like hardly any. There was slight pain for like maybe a second max and it just felt like a sharp menstrual cramp. And even after, I have had very little cramps and I am able to do everything normal and I don't feel it. I would recommend the Mirena to ANYONE",

I loved I didn't have to remember to take the pill everyday! I had random cramps throughout the months even when not on my period but other than that I liked it because it worked and made my periods lighter. Everyone on here saying that it's horrible... obviously it's different for everyone so I recomend you to try it out at least. Give it a chance because like I said it's different for everyone. It may be perfect for you or it may not be but you can't assume from some bad reviews until you try it!,

I remember how horrible it was to get put in, it was so uncomfortable, I was doubled over for days! It worked well, however, my super heavy periods had ceased and when my periods came back (about 5 years in), my PMS wasn't as bad and my cycle lasted and out 4 days with just some spotting. I still had cramps and developed migraines while on mirena. Today, I had it removed, which was still uncomfortable but not nearly as bad. It really worked well, but I think I won't go back on it. I could feel when it shifted, it did hurt, and I would often have unexplained cramping outside of my time and with no diagnosis. I recommend it as a long term option, especially if you have had a child. For women without children, do your research and ask many questions. I still remember the horrible cramping from when I had it put in.",

I had 2 times that I had really strong cramping during insertion.. My cervix was tight so they had to use a cervix softener....made me have a couple of hard cramping...and the other time was when she inserted it. I've had 3 kids (c-sections) and one miscarriage at 15 weeks so it was really not bad. I've not had any bleeding, not even spotting. Mild to moderate cramping afterward...lying down is a lot better than sitting up. I took Midol instead of straight Tylenol maybe that's why it isn't too bad.

Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 51 months ago (12/2/2016),Report,"This is the worst birth control I have ever been on. The reason it is so effective is because you not get a chance to have sex the entire time you have it. I have periods that last between 14 and 20 days and then i get maybe a week where I'm not bleeding. I have had the Mirena for 9 months and I hate it. I haven't gotten it removed because I keep thinking that my body will adjust and my periods will become regular or they will stop altogether, 9 months later and I still have near constant bleeding. I can't wait to get this thing out of me. I really miss my regular periods where I have 3 weeks where I don't have to worry. I have to admit that the worst part is that I never know when the bleeding will start, so I always carry pads and tampons and I feel like I have to check constantly. 1000% would not recommend.",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 51 months ago (12/2/2016),Report,"I just got a Jaydess IUD inserted, which is made by the same company as Mirena. They prescribe this one to young women who never gave birth, because it is smaller and contains less hormones. I can't say anything about long terms effects because I just got it, but so far I'm suprised by how easy it has been. The insersion barely felt worse than the first day of my period. I did feel the IUD go up into my uterus, which was unpleasant for about 10 seconds. The entire procedure lasted less than 5 minutes. I bled the rest of the day and basically just felt like regular period with cramps, and my cramps are usually very light. Before getting it, I read a bunch of reviews saying it was the worst pain in the world, so I walked in the doctor's office expecting the worst. The doctor did freeze my cervix before hand, which apparently not all doctors do. I'm guessing this and the two advils I took an hour before helped alot. I would say the entire procedure was uncomfortable rather than painful, and I'm 21 years old, never had children or even a pap smear.",

I have never had children so I was worried that it was going to be extremely painful. I took 800mg of Aleve about an hour beforehand. The best way to describe it is it is like getting a piercing, a sharp pain followed by more dull achy pain. There were 3 sharp pains, when they clamp your cervix, when they measure the size of your uterus and when they insert the Mirena. Each sharp pain was followed by what felt like a strong period cramp. The whole procedure only took about 5 min. It felt like the first day of my period for about 5 hours after but it wasn't bad, I even went Christmas shopping immediately after. It's now the next morning and I have had no bleeding or spotting and I'm not even cramping anymore! Before getting Mirena I had a really hard time deciding between that and Paragard but I am really happy I decided on Mirena since while I was at the doctor my OBGYN mentioned that this is the birth control she uses and she rarely recommends Paragard to women unless they really want a hormone free birth control or there is some medical reason they can't use Mirena.

The ring did not work for me and I found it difficult to remember to take my pill, even with an alarm. I have not had any children so the insertion of the mirena was definitely painful. It felt like i was having really bad period cramps x100.. I have a fairly high pain tolerance and I was not expecting that to hurt as bad as it did. However, the minute my doctor removed the clamps on my cervix and removed the speculum, it was instant relief. Small term pain for long term gain.

I'll have a period but it's so light that all I need is a panty liner and I'm good. I'll have random cramping every so often that catches me off guard but it goes away fairly quickly.

I go back this Monday for a new Mirena because when they removed it, the Dr could not get the new one back in.

I went to the doctor and they put me back on the pill in addition to the IUD to control my bleeding, and it actually helped me stop bleeding completely. I broke out with acne worse then I ever have when it was inserted, but this problem got better with the birth control and also acne vitamins. I didn't gain any extra weight as far as I could tell, and I am usually very prone to weight gain. My experience was bad because for me, sex was always slightly uncomfortable. My doctor was positive that it couldn't be the IUD, but since i've had it out, I haven't had any pain during sex. Also, I would get these excruciating cramps. Usually once a month I would suffer these cramps for a few days, and no medication seemed to help me. When I decided to have it out, my cramps were so bad I had to go to the emergency room to get it removed. I felt instantly better after!

I had it inserted by my Gynecologist. He was great. The whole procedure took about 5minutes total! It wasn't too bad. It felt very similar to a pap, the only difference was there was a bit of cramping when he removed my Copper IUD and the moment the Mirena was being placed but of course that cramping stopped as soon as he removed his tools. I was okay to drive home and had no problems. A couple hours later I did have some very intense cramping on and off.. this lasted for roughly 48 hours. I do have some mild cramping but nothing more then regular period pains. When I had it inserted I was on the 2nd day of my period. I would usually have 10-14 day periods with spotting at the start and end. My period are usually quite heavy. The Mirena instantly lowered the amount of blood loss which was GREAT for me.

Mirena did its job. I love not having to remember to take a pill, replace a ring, get a shot, or have something in my arm. The positive side effect imo, is not having a period. I haven't used a pad or tampon in years! The negative side effects include (very) mild cramping every once and a while and it is usually after sex. Other than that, I forget that Mirena is there. When I first got Mirena inserted, my husband could feel the strings and I got them trimmed back. Since then, no issues. now that my 5 years are almost over, I'm thinking about getting the 3 year iud if we don't try for another child. Some of my friends have had Mirena and each of us have had different experiences with it. Mine just happened to be the most uneventful and positive!

I hadon't it inserted almost 2 months ago and although I did have some cramping and spotting, it has been worth it. The insertion was slightly uncomfortable, but I did start cramping bad afterwards and for a few days afterwards. I also started spotting three days after the insertion but that only lasted maybe 3 weeks. Yes, it was a nuisance but I have not spotted any more in the past 3 weeks. But I have developed a discharge that it sometimes watery (TMI...I know) but it is slowly stopping. The doctor said this was normal. I'd rather deal with this than spotting. It hasn't been long since I had the mirena placed, but so far I am highly satisfied. I read review after reviews much of them being horrible. So, if you are thinking about getting an IUD know everyones body is different and side effects go away. Yes, it sucks to deal with it for a while, some longer than others, but it will be all worth it.",

I got the implant when I was 19 (am now 20), and the procedure was painful, like a really weird cramp. Really not too bad though - it's an individual thing, though. It was super easy for me. The actual procedure took maybe 2-3 minutes and I was out the door. For a couple days after it just felt like a normal period with cramps. Ever since I've felt great.

The insertion was incredibly painful for me, and took me down for about 3 hours. The real issues began about 2 months in, when I started getting dizzy spells and extreme nausea. I took about 4 different pregnancy tests before I was convinced I was not pregnant. Throughout the next three months, I had cyclical dizzy spells, nausea, cramping, bloating, and migraines. My bowel movements also changed dramatically - consistency, regularity, etc., and I did experience both acne (which I had never had issues with before - I'm 28) and weight gain. Mirena also made me very emotional. I know a lot of friends that Mirena works great for - your body's reaction to birth control is a very individual thing. I was highly sensitive to the hormones in higher dose pills as well, so I would say - if you are struggling with side effects of the pill, a hormonal IUD might not be right for you.",

I got the mirena inserted right before my period was about to start, if that makes a difference. I laid on the table nervous out of my mind to the point I was going to cry. They inserted the speculum, which I didn't feel except for the coldness of the tool. They then measured my cervix, which I do have to be honest and say it did hurt ALOT.

Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 52 months ago (10/10/2016),Report,"After reading so many different experiences from other women, I have to say that I've had a wonderful experience with Mirena since starting it in November 2014. Every woman responds to it differently. I will say that the insertion is painful and does cause cramping (equal to what you feel during your period). It wasn't horrible though and I even taught a cycling class on the same day mine was inserted. For the first 6 months I had spotting occasionally along with a regular, slightly lighter period. After that I've hardly noticed that it's in there. I continue to go about my normal life and still get a normal period. It has been so convenient and I definitely like it more than the NuvaRing, which made me very moody. It's been the perfect birth control and although I have not had kids, my body has adapted to this wonderfully. I should add that they suggest that women who have had kids prior to insertion are a better fit. If you feel this is right for you, give it a try. I'm certainly glad that I didn't let online reviews scare me away. The great thing is, if you react badly to it, you can always have it removed.",

I stopped having regular periods after 2 months, but the symptoms continued well past the 4 month mark. Everything was hunky dory until the 15 month mark when I began experiencing the severe cramps again. I returned to dr only to be told that the strings were missing.

My Dr. also gave me a shot of lidocain in my cervix. I would compare it to a PAP Smear. No, Its not comfortable by any means but theres a little bit of cramping & its over quick. I wasnt dizzy or had nausea. I spotted for 3 days and only used a thin liner each day. After the insertation day - I havent taken anything for cramps and no migraine yet. hope this helps!",

I have had my fair share of surgeries and ailments over the years. But NOTHING compared to the sheer frustration I have experienced with Mirena. Once the device was in, I started bleeding - as normal. Side effects can last from 3-6 months, so I was not worried. 2 weeks after the device was inserted I was still using between 2-3 tampons a day.

The side effects were mild and I could appreciate the clearer skin and lack of maintenance but then I began to get BV from the strings and this was super annoying. One evening while doing the check to make sure that the device was in place, I felt the bottom of the device. The next morning I had to have it removed because it was being expelled. Granted this may be an individual perspective. Unfortunately this device did not work for me and had more draw backs than benefits. Would not recommend.

My body did not like it (and for reference I am very healthy and work out 4 times a week). The cramping was worse than my regular period cramps...sharp, intense pain. I kept hoping they would subside, which they sort of have after 6 months but I still need to take extra strength Advil st least 4 times a week for these cramps. It's awful. Also, I read so much about how Mirena doesn't affect weight so I was surprised to gain 15 in the past 6 months. I actually work out more now! No hange in eating habits and then discovered there is indeed a group of women who gained weight and immediately lost it one the Mirena was removed.

Safe sex I do not have 6 hours migraine (of wanting-to-remove-my-eye-with-a-spoon pain) anymore. It got rid of my cramps that were a 8/10 on the pain scale.

I had been on Depo Provera for 1.5 years with nonstop bleeding, weight gain, moodiness, and any other hormonal side effect you can think of and was ready to try something new. I am a baby when it comes to pain, so I was REALLY dreading the insertion process. I won't lie, insertion was not fun, although I know my nerves made it worse than it actually was. Thankfully, it took less than 5 minutes. Right after, I felt dizzy and was in pain and lied down for 15 minutes before leaving. Full disclosure, I was in very bad pain for the next two hours to the point where I was ready to reach in and pull it out myself. I researched others' experiences and they said they had the pain for weeks. To my pleasant surprise, after going to the bathroom, calming down, and eating something, my pain went from a 10 to a 5 (tolerable) after 2 hours of insertion. By the end of the first night, I was okay (3 on the pain scale). The next morning, I was SHOCKED to find I had no pain and maybe the amount of discomfort of being a little gassy. I was even able to go to a concert that day and work the following day. ALSO, on the Depo",

However, mirena was still the best option for me, so I decided I could handle going through the discomfort. I suffer from very intense period cramps monthly so I figured I could manage it. I took ibuprofen before to prepare. The insertion went very well for me, it felt like a very intense and concentrated period cramp while my doctor was dilating my cervix. It wasn't fun, but also not the worst pain ever. When my doctor was able to get me dilated enough to try inserting the device I didn't really feel it at all.

However, 7 months later at an annual check-up I was diagnosed with hypothyroid. There isn't any supporting evidence that the Mirena is linked to thyroid issues at this point but looking through Mirena blogs it seems to be quite common.

It was a little more discomfort than a Pap smear along with a period cramp that lasted for <10 secs (at least for me). I was concerned about feeling the pain from tenaculum clamping my cervix and the pain that I was imagining did not occur (I am told that it has to do with how much pressure is used to close the tenaculums grip to stabilize/position your cervix and uterus, i.e. Some docs may clamp it a little firmer/tighter than others).

My doctor gave me tea and monitored me for 30 mins then sent me home with a couple percocets for pain. The doctor warned me of the dangers of having unprotected sex with the IUD, as it can increase your risk of PID if you have sexually transmitted diseases (such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea) that can sometimes be asymptomatic conditions. I think this is an important warning, as PID is very serious and can result in infertility. I did have ovarian cysts for the first time in my life after the insertion of my IUD.

Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 57 months ago (6/8/2016),Report,"I had the iud inserted about a month ago. I was excited to try something new after just having a baby. My friends all have it and have had no problems with it. Two weeks ago I had cramping that felt worse then my contractions but because it was new and got better after a day I figured it was just part of the process. Turns out it wasn't. Last week I went to doctor for the mild cramping and in ability to eat for five days without pain. Later that night I had emergency surgery to remove the iud from my abdomen. It had broke through my uterus about two weeks prior.When I got the iud I knew there was a risk, but didn't figure I would be that less than 1%. Like anything the iud works good for most people, but then again not for everyone. Hope this helps.",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 57 months ago (6/7/2016),Report,"I had Mirena put in about a week and a half ago. I am 23 and have never had children, but was never warned that the insertion would be a problem. Once I arrived for the appointment I sat down with the the mid wife who would be inserting the Mirena and she said it would be ""uncomfortable"". I literally never experienced a pain like this. I was gripping the table and moaning the entire time, which was truly like 10 seconds of actual excruciating pain, but it still was awful. Afterward I stayed on the table for about 15 minutes because I felt like I would fall over if I stood up. I didn't realize how badly this would affect me so I never took time off of work. I went straight to work after the procedure and was miserable. Fast forward to today...I feel relatively normal, aside from occasional sharp pains or cramping. My boyfriend and I have had sex once since I had the Mirena inserted and I was completely freaked out the entire time so I definitely didn't enjoy myself. If he went too far inside me, I started to feel a similar sharp sensation like when I had Mirena inserted. Definitely not as terrible, but enough to make me nervous. I am still bleeding daily, but it is completely manage",

Then explain had made me bleed for 6 months straight and the pills gave me awful headaches. So when I decided to switch it was a last resort. I am 16 years old and when I had the IUD inserted I was not on my period. I have never had any kids either, so the pain when I got it in was pretty bad but 100% worth it. It only took maybe 7 minutes? Considering I'm so young and could deal with the pain says a lot. I experienced cramping for the rest of the day but the next day I was fine. I have had it for 2 months now and have not had a period yet. I absolutely love the Mirena and recommend it for all ages!",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 57 months ago (6/7/2016),Report,"I have had mirena for four years now. I honestly can say it is effective. I chose mirena because I've tried the pills but didn't do anything but make me sleepy, then depo. It worked but couldn't keep going to the doc and gained weight. Mirena is effective. But, I've experienced the most pain I've ever felt in my life. While w/ mirena. I had a ovarian cyst. Never had one prior to mirena. It would twist. Cause the most pain ever. The pain went away 1 year ago. Don't need surgery. Thank god. But I do not want to ever experience that again. I am skeptical about using mirena again once I get mirena removed. I don't like the fact that mirena is still in place (ultrasound reviewed) yet I can't feel the strings. It will be painful just to remove mirena. I am thinking about either back to depo, nexplanon or skyla. I have to discuss with obgyn. But I must warn about mirena. Mirena can cause ovarian cyst and that can be a plain. Also always check your strings.",

I have not stopped cramping yet it ranges from moderate to severe and i cant sit for long periods of time or i start getting a fever and chills due to the pain. Im bloated and swollen and my lower abdomen is tender to the touch. I have had 2 children and my Doctor told me i shouldnt feel cramping at all. Well its the worst pain ive been through in a while even my child labor wasnt this bad. I have an appointment next monday to get it out. Oh and i havent stopped bleeding ive gon through an entire 36 ct tampon box and half a box of 108 ct panty liners. I think there may be something wrong for sure. But enough about me, my husband and I tried to be intimate and the strings poke him the entire time and one apparently ...went inside his urethra. He wont have sex with me until i get it out due to the pain it causes him. Not that i want to being in this much pain and bleeding so much. Absolutly not for me.",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 57 months ago (6/7/2016),Report,"This is my completely honest review of the Mirena IUD. I've been on it for 3 months now, and so far I love it! Even though I love it now, I gave it 4 stars because of one thing: The insertion. At my first appointment, the doctor let me know that since I'd never had a child (I'm currently 21 with no children) that my cervix would never have been enlarged and therefore the insertion would be ""uncomfortable"" and that I take pain medication (tylenol type stuff) an hour prior to coming in (which I did). I went in not thinking much of it, since I'm pretty fine when it comes to pain. I've had broken bones, hurt myself playing sports, I have 2 tattoos - I thought nothing of it. However, being completely 100% honest... The pain was like NOTHING I ever expected. I was in so much pain that I apparently turned white, and they had me lie down for awhile after. I straight up felt so dizzy and was very close to vomiting (which I must stress, NEVER happens to me, ever). I was incredibly glad that I had gotten my mom to come with me to the appointment, since I was in so much agony I couldn't even drive myself home. I waddled upstairs straight to my bed, and popped 2 Tylenol 3's from my wisdom",

I'm a mother I can tell you that childbirth is the most excruciating pain I have ever endured. I don't look forward to reinsertion but I deal with it. The cramping is moderate and only lasted until the next day. I would highly recommend Mirena and I can't tell you how much I enjoy not having a period. I have used this product twice, 10 years in total, with absolutely no issues. I recently decided to try the Paragard because it lasts 12 years and doesn't utilize hormones. It's been over a month and I still have no complaints! Understandably people have different experiences but for me, this is the most effortless and reliable birth control available so I think you're doing yourself a disservice not to try it.",

Rated  for Contraception Report,Posted 57 months ago (6/4/2016),Report,"I felt like it was important to share my experience with the Mirena IUD because I have found other people’s reviews so helpful. I got the Mirena two months ago for a number of reasons, namely: 1) PMS. I had always struggled with PMT and noticed that my emotional symptoms were really affecting my relationship and my career. It was clear that my symptoms were tied to PMT because the pattern was always the same – exactly five days before my period was due, I would feel anxious, restless and irritable and any issues I had been suppressing would come bubbling up to the surface. I’d feel fat and bloated and my irritability would continue to increase until the moment my period started, which is when I would feel a wave of calm wash over me. I always knew if my period was going to start the next day because I would experience acute insomnia and anxiety the night before it was due, which was incredibly tough if I had something important to do the next day like an interview or presentation. Even though I relished the sense of calm, which accompanied the onset of my period, my period also caused me to become absent-minded and forgetful, which really affected my work. I would also",
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 57 months ago (6/3/2016),Report,"I just got the mirena placed in yesterday. I have had 2 c sections, my last one was 4 years ago so the doctor had to dilate my cervix to place the mirena. All in all the pain was about a 5 for me which is really not that bad because I am a wimp. The dilation was not painful at all. The whole process took about 10 minutes because the nurse had to run out and get the instrument to dilate me. I had very light cramping yesterday and was a tiny bit nauseous and tired but today I feel a lot better, just a tiny bit of cramping here and there. I am spotting a bit but nothing a thin liner can't handle. I will post another review in a couple months to let others know how it's working out.",

I am a healthy (5'8"", 150 lbs) 24 year old with no children or desire for them, and I mainly opted for the IUD because my PA said it was my best chance at stopping my periods. Not getting knocked up is great, too. The placement of the IUD was pretty painful, although I do have a low tolerance for uterine pain. I bled somewhat heavily after the procedure and did nothing the rest of the day. The next morning I was fine, and I had no periods or spotting, mood swings, or cramps for about 1.5 years. About six months ago, I started bleeding again on almost a monthly basis. I'm sure everyone's body is different, but I have noticed that eating clean (vegan and mostly vegetables) and completing at least 30-60 minutes of physical activity/day seems to stop my periods. So for those of you who are sick and tired of being miserable and bleeding needlessly every month for a week, this does seem to be the magic combination for me, so I hope it works for you.",

The insertion to me was nowhere near as bad as the stories I read before hand, it wasn't a glorious feeling but definitely tolerable. I was fine the first couple weeks with slight cramping then all of a sudden 7 days ago woke with horrible cervical and lower back pain. I'm not talking about the ""I have cramps and need chocolate and a heating pad"", I'm talking about wanting to curl in a ball and cry for my momma kind of pain. Finally tired of it went this morning and it was removed due to so much pain and come to find out my body was trying to reject and push it out. I can't say it's a horrible choice as I only had it almost a month but I can say if your body rejects it or if it moves etc you will feel it and it's horrible. Good luck to any trying this but definitely don't let the horror stories scare you....go try for yourself it may be great for you or bad and you go have it removed which by the way I felt nothing having it removed.",

And in the hours after, I'm just experiencing some moderate cramping and spotting! Make note, I had mirena inserted during my period and took 800mg of ibuprofen 40 minutes prior.

I'm getting it removed soon... If you decide to get it I hope your experience is much better than mine has been.,
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 57 months ago (5/11/2016),Report,I got my first mirena inserted after the birth of my second son in 2008. I just had it removed and replaced with a second one today. Yes it's been 7 1/2 years and it was effective the whole time. I speak very highly of this form of birth control. With the first one I did bleed for about a month but mostly spotting. And then nothing for the last 7+ years. Having it taken out was so simple and I felt absolutely no pain. Putting the second one in I had slight cramping and still do obviously since it was done this morning... but not continuously. Also very minimal spotting but no different from the first time. I read so many horror stories on this but I just wanted to share my experience because I do believe people need to be aware that for some it may have negative effects but for me I would do it over and over again. To all thinking about it I wish you the best of luck and hope you have the same great experience I have had with it!,
Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 57 months ago (5/10/2016),Report,I got the mirena because I have terrible Migraines and the birth control pills were making them even worse. I got the IUD a year and a half ago - my doctor told me nothing about insertion - it was very painful and I almost passed out and had terrible cramps for a few days. After I got use to it - it was a great birth control! I still had periods every month - however the past 8 months - I started getting a ton of bladder infections. Maybe 1-2 per month. I also drink a ton of water - and pee a lot in general - but after I got the mirena - I noticed I was peeing way too much. I dealt with it for a year and a half....I probably peed maybe 20-30 times a day. 8-9 times each night and way too much during the day. My doctor didn't think this was causing this. About 3 weeks ago I started having terrible pain down in my lady parts and I wasn't close to my period. I went in for an ultrasound and I have ruptered cysts...not saying the mirena is the cause of that - but I went in for my yearly checkup and decided to get my mirena removed due to the many bladder infections - the pee party that I had every single day - and possible cysts. I got the mirena removed about 2 weeks ago - I now pee l,

Throughout my lifetime before the Mirena I've had a history of depression and hormonal issues taking birth control. Since the age I was sexually active at 16 I tried every other the counter option: the ring, pills , patch, condoms even tried the diaphragm. On top of this I would have extremely painful periods in which I would lay around all day and take close to 12 Advil daily. One doctor recommended the IUD to me. At this time the IDU was fairly new and I was not comfortable doing the procedure. Fast forward to 6 years later I finally got the courage to follow through with my boyfriend holding my hand. The insertion procedure was extremely painful for me because my cervix is very small and tilted and i've never had kids. I took the rest of the day off work and I was back to work the next day. I was nauseous and a bit dizzy but that's all. My periods are now very very little compared to before I would have an extremely heavy flow for a week. Now they last a few days, if that, with minimal blood.... and best part usually NO CRAMPS!! I gained 6 pounds when I first",

I had slight cramping during the procedure and cramping the next few days. Overall I didn't have an awful experience having the IUD put in. I have bled just about everyday since I've had it- MAYBE 5 days total that I haven't (not consecutive) I have had an increase in anxiety at night to the point of taking Zzzquil to help me fall asleep. I've had anxiety prior but not like this where I was having panic attacks at night all the time. I also have had severe headaches. All these things combined I wouldn't recommend this birth control.

Keep in mind I am 18 and have never had a child. So when I had the Mirena inserted it was extremely uncomfortable and extremely painful. I quickly broke into a cold sweat, got very pale, so dizzy, and had terrible nause, my blood pressure also dropped extremely low. I laid on the table in the doctors office for about an hour until I got myself together, but still had to call someone for a ride home. Afterward I had terrible cramping for about 2 weeks, along with bleeding. My doctor said the cramping was due the fact that my uterus was so small because I have never had any children, so I was just getting used to it being there. The cramping has since went away ( It is over a month later ) but I am still bleeding, it is way less than a period, not clotty either. When I think it's done, it will start again. My doctor said it is just what your body does until it gets used to it.

Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 58 months ago (5/3/2016),Report,"The best choice I made with birth control by far. I got Mirena when I was 19, and had no children. I have had it for 4 years now and if I do not plan on getting pregnant immediately after I will choose an IUD as my first choice. The first several months were bumpy, lots of cramps and off and on bleeding. After about 4 months I noticed no period at all. This continued until I began to have regular sex (I assume my hormones reacted) then I began to have light periods and some cramping before hand. The biggest complaint I have is that I have gotten numerous yeast infections within the past year, some doctors will tell me it is because of the bacteria that collects on the string. Others will tell me that would not cause this. Since taking vaginal medication this is not an issue. Overall, this is a girls best friend in contraception, little to worry or forgetting the pill, and my period is nearly non existent! I do fear having it taken out but that's a day for another review.",

I did have cramping for about the first month. Period slowed a lot, not its either non existent or it spots a little. A panty liner is usually enough. It's a little unpredictable which is inconvenient. Sometimes I'll also have cramps but no bleeding. I like it because I don't have to think about it.",

Rated  for Birth Control Report,Posted 58 months ago (4/29/2016),Report,"I've had the Mirena about 3 months. 1st month was fine. I experienced some extra bleeding in which I was warned about... After the 1st month I began having a white milky discharge (no smell) , slight itching, and slight constant burning in the outter vaginal area. Went to the physician only for my cultures to be returned normal... After 30 more days I began having acne and the slight burning continued .... I became very depressed and purchased every feminine product I could in the store, visited the doctor again... Only to receive normal results again. I absolutely do not want to be touched sexually and I'm very sad. The Mirena did not work for me at all and I would not recommend it to anyone. I'm getting it taken out as soon as possible.","Having not had a child previous, and also being on Depo for years so that I couldn't have it placed during a period, I was nervous about insertion... The insertion itself did NOT hurt very much, however they did need to manually dilate my cervix, which was incredibly uncomfortable, with severe cramping. After the IUD was placed, I stood up and immediately experienced horrible waves of nausea, tunnel vision, increased sound sensitivity, and was drenched immediately in sweat. I could barely make it to the chair to put on my underwear. When the nurse came in to give me the corresponding card to my Mirena, I described my symptoms and she said it had nothing to do with the IUD, but rather that this was my body's reaction to dilation, and that it was not at all uncommon. While that would have been nice to know before hand, I recovered within 20 minutes and was able to leave. I had severe cramping, even on 1200 mg of Ibuprofen, for the rest of the day. I DID go to a work out class that evening, which helped the cramping significantly. For the rest of the week, though, I had only minor on-and-off cramping. No spotting after the first day. Much less cramping on days after an evening work"

Rated  for Endometriosis Report ,Posted 5 months ago (9/17/2020),Report ,"Insertion was ok, not to painful. But - I had to have Mirena removed, soon after insertion - after 10 days of severe painful cramping. Doctors wanted me to wait 3-6 months, but it would be a nightmare to wait 3 months in such discomfort. So I insisted on removal (doctors are often reluctant to agree to early removal). I do not recommend it. Doctors give too little info beforehand about the side effects. It is certainly no walk in the park! I feel much better now, in control of my body. Better to feel sick few days per month, than to have PMS and pain nonstop everyday. For contraception, bc pills or condoms are a much nicer option! Not even close to such side effects as Mirena.",

It’s not perfect and I regularly spot bleed (a liner will suffice). But I no longer have the mood swings and haemorrhaging every 3 weeks. So life with Merina is pretty good in comparison. I write this review, because I read so many horror stories when doing my research. If you are scared, try it. My weight is the same, my skin still looks clear and I have better moods now than before.

After suffering with shocking heavy and painful periods for 18 years before I was finally diagnosed with endo - I was recommended the Mirena after I had my first child. Because I kept reading negative reviews I became terrified to get Mirena but when I finally chose to go ahead with it I was amazed. I was told that it wouldn't be too painful to have it inserted as I'd had a vaginal birth in the past 10 months. For me personally it wasn't painful at all - there was slight pinching and discomfort but only for what felt like 2 minutes. There was no pain afterwards just slight dizziness. I experienced mild cramping for a few days. I've had it now for 6 months and even though ive had quite a bit of intermittent spotting, I haven't actually had any bleeding or flow. It's been amazing. And no pain, just a bit of discomfort. I believe the spotting will continue to improve. Coming from someone that lived with ridiculously heavy periods to now only have spotting - I highly recommend giving it a try! It's worth it in case it does work for you too.",

It worked well save for making my periods heavy, but i ultimately had it removed due to one particular period where i was passing massive blood clots and cramping more than usual. Before Paragaurd, my periods were mild. No cramping, moderate bleeding for about five days. My gyno recommended i get Mirena, as it would help with the bleeding, so i did. Insertion was painful, but about the same as Paragaurd (I nearly passed out driving home though). Almost instantly, Mirena changed everything in my body chemistry. I suffer from bipolar disorder, which I am medicated for. My bipolar had been under control for nearly half a year at that point. Three days after i had the mirena inserted, my emotions were completely off the rails. I was screaming at my boyfriend, convinced my friends hated me, and had suicidal thoughts again for the first time in six months. My psychiatrist upped my dosage which was able to bring me back under control again, but more depressed than totally level.
